<h1>Peak Season Management: How Flat Fee Saves You During High Rates</h1>

<h2>The Commission Trap: Why Peak Seasons Cost Owners More</h2>

<p>During Chinese New Year, school holidays, and other peak periods, Airbnb rates in Melaka can increase by <strong>40-60%</strong>. For commission-based management companies, this means <strong>their fees also increase by 40-60%</strong> - essentially punishing you for success.</p>

<p>iHousing's <strong>flat fee model</strong> (RM200-300/month) operates differently: <strong>your costs stay the same</strong> whether you're charging RM150 or RM450 per night. This structural advantage becomes dramatically valuable during peak seasons.</p>

<h3>The Commission Multiplier Effect</h3>

<p>Watch how commission eats your peak-season profits:</p>

<h2>Why Commission Companies Love Peak Seasons</h2>

<p>Commission-based managers have <strong>zero incentive</strong> to minimize their fees during peak periods:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>More revenue for you</strong> = <strong>more commission for them</strong> (win-win for them)</li>
<li><strong>No rate cap:</strong> They benefit from every rate increase you implement</li>
<li><strong>No skin in the game:</strong> Their profit grows regardless of guest satisfaction</li>
<li><strong>Hidden alignment:</strong> They actually prefer higher rates even if it reduces occupancy</li>
</ul>

<h3>iHousing's Incentive Alignment</h3>

<p>With flat fees, <strong>our incentives match yours</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>We profit from occupancy</strong>, not just rates (more bookings = happy client)</li>
<li><strong>We optimize for total revenue</strong>, not maximizing daily rate at expense of occupancy</li>
<li><strong>Peak season strategy:</strong> Balance rate premium vs occupancy to maximize your total revenue</li>
<li><strong>Long-term client value:</strong> We want you profitable for years, not just one peak season</li>
</ul>

<h2>Peak Season Pricing Strategy: Flat Fee Advantage</h2>

<h3>Commission Company Behavior</h3>

<p>When managing for 20% commission:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Push rates higher:</strong> RM400/night when RM350 achieves same occupancy</li>
<li><strong>Risk tolerance:</strong> Accept vacancy risk chasing maximum rates</li>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong> "We got you RM450/night!" (ignoring empty dates)</li>
<li><strong>Incentive:</strong> Higher rate = higher commission even if fewer total nights</li>
</ul>

<h3>iHousing Behavior</h3>

<p>When managing for flat fee:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize total revenue:</strong> RM350/night at 90% occupancy > RM450/night at 60% occupancy</li>
<li><strong>Risk mitigation:</strong> Balance premium pricing with occupancy security</li>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong> "We achieved RM9,450 in CNY revenue at 92% occupancy"</li>
<li><strong>Incentive:</strong> Your total revenue maximizes our long-term relationship value</li>
</ul>

<h2>Switching to Flat Fee: Mid-Season Considerations</h2>

<h3>Best Timing to Switch</h3>

<p>Optimal timing for switching from commission to flat fee:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Immediately before peak season:</strong> Capture full savings (switch NOW for CNY 2026)</li>
<li><strong>Mid-shoulder season:</strong> Smooth transition, less disruption</li>
<li><strong>Avoid mid-peak:</strong> Can disrupt existing bookings (though we minimize this)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Switching During CNY</h3>

<p>Even switching during peak season works:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Calendar preservation:</strong> All existing bookings honored</li>
<li><strong>Rate maintenance:</strong> No changes to confirmed reservations</li>
<li><strong>Immediate savings:</strong> New bookings immediately benefit from flat fee</li>
<li><strong>Smooth transition:</strong> Guests unaware of management change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculate Your Peak Season Savings</h2>

<p>Use this formula to estimate your savings:</p>

<p><strong>Peak Revenue × Commission Rate = Peak Season Fee</strong></p>

<p><strong>Flat Fee = RM 200-300/month (regardless of revenue)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Savings = Peak Season Fee - Flat Fee</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your CNY revenue: RM 8,000</li>
<li>At 20% commission: RM 1,600 fee</li>
<li>At iHousing flat fee: RM 250</li>
<li><strong>Your savings: RM 1,350</strong></li>
</ul>
