<h1>Coastal Property Turnaround: From 40% to 75% Occupancy in 3 Months</h1>

<h2>The Problem: Empty Beach House, Wasted Revenue</h2>

<p>When Mr. Lim first approached iHousing, his 3-bedroom beachfront condo in Pantai Kundur was struggling:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Occupancy rate:</strong> 40% (sitting empty most weekdays)</li>
  <li><strong>Monthly revenue:</strong> RM4,800 (far below potential)</li>
  <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Listed only on Airbnb</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Flat RM300/night regardless of demand</li>
  <li><strong>Reviews:</strong> 3.8/5 (below average)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The owner's frustration:</strong> "I invested RM450,000 in this beachfront property, but it's barely covering its costs. Something has to change."</p>

<h2>The iHousing Assessment</h2>

<h3>What We Found</h3>

<p>After analyzing the property, we identified five critical issues:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Flat rates meant losing money on weekends and remaining empty midweek</li>
  <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Dark, poorly lit images that didn't showcase ocean views</li>
  <li><strong>Listing:</strong> Generic description with no personality or local tips</li>
  <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Missing 45% of potential guests by being Airbnb-only</li>
  <li><strong>Guest experience:</strong> No welcome guide, slow communication, basic amenities</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Potential</h3>

<p>We saw a property with tremendous potential:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prime beachfront location (unobstructed ocean views)</li>
  <li>3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (sleeps 6 comfortably)</li>
  <li>Modern kitchen and spacious living area</li>
  <li>Access to pool and gym facilities</li>
  <li>Near local attractions (Tanjung Bidara, seafood restaurants)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our assessment:</strong> With the right strategy, this property could achieve 75%+ occupancy and RM10,000+/month revenue.</p>

<h2>Challenges Faced (and How We Solved Them)</h2>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduced weekend premium during monsoon (from +40% to +25%)</li>
  <li>Offered "Monsoon Special" packages (4+ nights, 20% off)</li>
  <li>Targeted remote workers (quiet, storm-watching stays)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Maintained 60% occupancy even in low season</p>

<h3>Challenge #2: Short Notice Cancellations</h3>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Last-minute cancellations left gaps in calendar</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Moderate cancellation policy (not strict)</li>
  <li>Same-day rebooking discounts</li>
  <li>Backlog of interested guests for waitlist</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Refilled 80% of cancelled dates within 48 hours</p>

<h3>Challenge #3: Wear and Tear</h3>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Increased occupancy meant more maintenance needs</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Professional cleaning after every checkout</li>
  <li>Monthly deep cleaning</li>
  <li>Preventive maintenance schedule</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Property maintained in excellent condition, reviews reflect it</p>
