<h1>Transparent Airbnb Management: Why Flat Fee Beats Commission Every Time</h1>

<h2>20% Commission Sounds Simple. But What Are You REALLY Paying?</h2>

<p>You're comparing Airbnb management companies in Melaka. Most charge <strong>15-25% commission</strong> on your revenue. It seems straightforward - they earn a percentage, you keep the rest.</p>

<p><strong>Here's what they don't tell you:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Commission models charge <strong>hidden markups</strong> on cleaning, maintenance, and supplies</li>
  <li>Your effective cost is often <strong>25-35% of revenue</strong>, not the quoted 20%</li>
  <li>Higher revenue = you pay MORE for the SAME service</li>
  <li>Low season discounts? They still charge full commission</li>
</ul>

<p>Flat fee management is different: <strong>You pay the same amount every month</strong>, regardless of how many bookings you get. No hidden fees. No markups. No surprises.</p>

<p>This article shows you exactly why transparent, flat fee pricing saves you money and gives you better service.</p>

<h2>Commission Model: The Hidden Costs</h2>

<h3>What 20% Commission Actually Looks Like</h3>

<p>Let's break down the <strong>real cost</strong> of commission-based management on a Melaka condo earning RM12,000/year gross:</p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Fee Category</th>
      <th>Commission Model (20%)</th>
      <th>What It Really Costs You</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Base commission</strong></td>
      <td>20% of revenue</td>
      <td>RM2,400/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Cleaning markup</strong></td>
      <td>30-50% markup on service</td>
      <td>RM1,800-3,000/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Maintenance margin</strong></td>
      <td>15-25% markup on repairs</td>
      <td>RM300-600/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Supply markups</strong></td>
      <td>20% on essentials</td>
      <td>RM150-300/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>"Emergency" fees</strong></td>
      <td>RM50-100 per incident</td>
      <td>RM300-1,200/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong><strong>TOTAL ANNUAL COST</strong></strong></td>
      <td><strong>Advertised: 20%</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Actual: 27-35%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Your net income</strong></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>RM7,000-8,200/year</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> That "20% commission" actually costs you <strong>RM4,950-5,800/year</strong>, not RM2,400.</p>

<h3>Why Commission Models Hide Fees</h3>

<p>Commission-based managers make money through <strong>multiple revenue streams</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Base commission:</strong> Their quoted percentage</li>
  <li><strong>Cleaning markup:</strong> They charge you RM110 for a RM80 clean</li>
  <li><strong>Maintenance margin:</strong> They add 20% to contractor bills</li>
  <li><strong>Supply markups:</strong> They charge retail prices, pocket bulk savings</li>
  <li><strong>Fees and penalties:</strong> Late check-out fees, key replacement fees, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Every time your property needs something, they profit. <strong>No incentive to save you money.</strong></p>

<h2>Flat Fee Model: Complete Transparency</h2>

<h3>What You Pay (Exactly)</h3>

<p>With flat fee management, you know <strong>exactly</strong> what you'll pay each month:</p>

<h4>Parkland Avenue by the Sea (Exclusive Pricing)</h4>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Unit Size</th>
      <th>Monthly Fee</th>
      <th>Annual Fee</th>
      <th>What's Included</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1 Room</td>
      <td>RM200</td>
      <td>RM2,400</td>
      <td rowspan="3" style="vertical-align: middle;">Everything (see below)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2 Rooms</td>
      <td>RM250</td>
      <td>RM3,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3 Rooms</td>
      <td>RM300</td>
      <td>RM3,600</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>That's it.</strong> No additional fees. No markups. No percentage cuts.</p>

<h3>What's Included in Flat Fee</h3>

<p>For your RM200-300/month, you receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>✅ Guest communication responsive</strong> - Response within 30 minutes, multi-language (EN, MS, ZH)</li>
  <li><strong>✅ Professional cleaning</strong> - After every checkout, in-house team, NO markup</li>
  <li><strong>✅ Maintenance coordination</strong> - Trusted contractors, you pay cost only, NO margin</li>
  <li><strong>✅ 5-platform listing</strong> - Airbnb, Booking.com, Agoda, VRBO, Expedia with calendar sync</li>
  <li><strong>✅ Dynamic pricing</strong> - Algorithm-based pricing, automatic adjustments</li>
  <li><strong>✅ Professional photography</strong> - High-res photos optimized for each platform</li>
  <li><strong>✅ Monthly reporting</strong> - Transparent income statements, occupancy data, guest reviews</li>
  <li><strong>✅ Zero hidden fees</strong> - No emergency charges, no cleaning markups, no maintenance margins</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Compare to commission:</strong> You'd pay RM2,400-3,600 for base management, PLUS RM2,000-5,000 in hidden markups and fees.</p>

<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> As your revenue grows, commission costs increase. Flat fee stays the same.</p>

<h2>The "More You Earn, More You Pay" Problem</h2>

<h3>Commission Model Disincentivizes Performance</h3>

<p>With commission pricing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your property earns RM10,000/year:</strong> They make RM2,000</li>
  <li><strong>Your property earns RM15,000/year:</strong> They make RM3,000</li>
  <li><strong>Your property earns RM20,000/year:</strong> They make RM4,000</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You work harder (or your property location does), you pay MORE for the SAME service.</p>

<h3>Flat Fee Incentivizes Performance</h3>

<p>With flat fee pricing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your property earns RM10,000/year:</strong> You pay RM3,000, keep RM7,000</li>
  <li><strong>Your property earns RM15,000/year:</strong> You pay RM3,000, keep RM12,000</li>
  <li><strong>Your property earns RM20,000/year:</strong> You pay RM3,000, keep RM17,000</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your manager is motivated to MAXIMIZE your revenue. Your gain = their gain (better reviews, more referrals).</p>

<h2>Transparency Matters: What You Can See</h2>

<h3>Commission Statements vs Flat Fee Reports</h3>

<p><strong>Commission-based statement (typical):</strong></p>

<pre>Gross Revenue: RM1,000
Management Fee: RM200
Cleaning: RM120
Maintenance: RM85
Supplies: RM45
Platform Fees: RM100
<strong>Net to Owner: RM450</strong></pre>

<p><strong>What you don't see:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual cleaning cost: RM80 (charged RM120)</li>
  <li>Actual repair cost: RM65 (charged RM85)</li>
  <li>Actual supply cost: RM30 (charged RM45)</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden markups: RM45</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flat fee report (iHousing):</strong></p>

<pre>Gross Revenue: RM1,000
<strong>Monthly Management Fee: RM250</strong>
Cleaning (actual cost): RM80
Maintenance (actual cost): RM65
Supplies (actual cost): RM30
Platform Fees: RM100
<strong>Net to Owner: RM475</strong></pre>

<p><strong>What you see:</strong> Exactly what everything costs. No hidden margins.</p>

<h2>Why Most Managers Don't Offer Flat Fee</h2>

<h3>Commission is More Profitable (for Them)</h3>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>They Earn</th>
      <th>You Keep</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Commission (20% + hidden fees)</strong></td>
      <td>RM4,950-5,500/year</td>
      <td>RM7,000-8,200/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Flat Fee (RM250/mo)</strong></td>
      <td>RM3,000/year</td>
      <td>RM9,000/year</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Simple math:</strong> Commission models earn RM2,000-2,500 MORE per property than flat fee.</p>

<p><strong>Why we choose flat fee:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Transparency builds trust</li>
  <li>Owners stay longer (lower churn)</li>
  <li>Referrals from happy owners</li>
  <li>We sleep better at night</li>
</ul>
