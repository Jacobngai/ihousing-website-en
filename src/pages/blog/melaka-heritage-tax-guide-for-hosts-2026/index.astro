<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Do I Need to Pay Heritage Tax for My Melaka Airbnb?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>Yes. In 2026, all short-term rentals in Melaka are subject to the RM2/night Heritage Charge per room.</strong> This is separate from the Federal Tourism Tax (TTx) of RM10/night for foreign guests. Ignoring this can result in hefty fines from the Melaka Historic City Council (MBMB).</p>
</div>

<p>Taxes are boring, but fines are painful. As Melaka's tourism sector matures, the state government is strictly enforcing tax collection to fund heritage preservation.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we automate tax collection and remittance for our owners. If you are self-managing, here is what you need to know to stay out of trouble.</p>

<h2>1. The Heritage Charge (Cukai Warisan)</h2>

<p>This is a state-level tax applicable to hotels, homestays, and Airbnbs.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> RM 2.00 per room, per night.</li>
    <li><strong>Who Pays:</strong> All guests (Malaysian and Foreigner).</li>
    <li><strong>Collection Method:</strong> You must collect this from the guest and remit it to the Melaka State Government bi-monthly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. The Federal Tourism Tax (TTx)</h2>

<p>This is a national tax enforced by the Royal Malaysian Customs Department.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> RM 10.00 per room, per night.</li>
    <li><strong>Who Pays:</strong> Foreign passport holders only. (Malaysians and PRs are exempt).</li>
    <li><strong>Exemption:</strong> If you have fewer than 5 rooms registered under one owner, you <em>might</em> be exempt, but you must register to claim this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Collect Taxes Without Annoying Guests</h2>

<p>Asking for cash at the door is awkward. Here are the best practices:</p>

<h3>Option A: Include it in the Nightly Rate</h3>
<p>Mark up your listing price by RM12-15 to cover the taxes.
<br><strong>Pros:</strong> Seamless guest experience. No cash handling.
<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Makes your listing look more expensive on search results.</p>

<h3>Option B: The "Resolution Center" Request</h3>
<p>After booking, send a request via Airbnb Resolution Center for the tax amount.
<br><strong>Pros:</strong> Keeps the base price low.
<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Guests might refuse or forget to pay.</p>

<h3>Option C: Cash on Arrival</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Immediate cash flow.
<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Guests hate this. It feels like a scam. They often don't have small change.</p>

<h2>The Cost of Non-Compliance</h2>

<p>The penalty for evading Heritage Tax can be up to <strong>RM 5,000</strong> or revocation of your business license. MBMB officers conduct random audits, often posing as guests to check receipts.</p>

<h2>Sample Calculation (2-Bedroom Condo)</h2>

<p>Let's say you host a family of 4 (Foreigners) for 3 nights at <strong>The Shore</strong>.</p>
