<h1>Expedia vs Airbnb Platform Reach: Which Drives More Melaka Bookings?</h1>

<h2>Is Listing on Expedia Worth It for Melaka Properties?</h2>

<p>Most Melaka Airbnb owners have never considered listing on Expedia. But Expedia Group is the world's largest travel platform, reaching 400+ million monthly visitors across Expedia, Hotels.com, VRBO, and Travelocity.</p>

<p>For Melaka properties, Expedia delivers a different guest segment: corporate travelers, package tourists, and international visitors who DON'T use Airbnb.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we've listed on Expedia since 2019. Here's what we've learned about Expedia vs. Airbnb for Melaka properties.</p>

<p><strong>Expedia advantage:</strong> If your property caters to business travelers or families, Expedia reaches guests Airbnb doesn't.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Cost analysis:</strong> Expedia charges 2× higher commission BUT guests pay 15-25% premium rates. Net result: Similar or HIGHER net revenue despite higher fees.</p>

<h2>Listing Strategy: Expedia-Specific Optimization</h2>

<h3>What Works on Expedia</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Professional, bright, wide-angle (hotel-style photography)</li>
  <li><strong>Title:</strong> Property-focused (\"2BR Apartment in Melaka Raya\" not \"Charming Heritage Condo\")</li>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> Detailed amenities list, proximity to business/attractions, room specifications</li>
  <li><strong>Amenities:</strong> Emphasize business-friendly features (WiFi, desk, parking, kitchen, laundry)</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Higher base rate, corporate-friendly (no dynamic discounts)</li>
  <li><strong>Policies:</strong> Clear cancellation, check-in/out times, house rules (like hotels)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The iHousing Expedia Strategy</h2>

<p>We don't just list on Expedia. We OPTIMIZE for Expedia's specific guest segment:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Corporate positioning:</strong> For business district properties, we highlight desk space, high-speed WiFi, proximity to commercial areas</li>
  <li><strong>Family positioning:</strong> For family-friendly properties, we emphasize bedrooms, kitchen, laundry, nearby attractions</li>
  <li><strong>Hotel-like consistency:</strong> We ensure cleaning, amenities, and communication meet hotel standards (Expedia guests expect this)</li>
  <li><strong>Extended stay discounts:</strong> Expedia guests stay longer (5-7 nights). We offer weekly discounts to attract them</li>
  <li><strong>Corporate packages:</strong> For business travelers, we offer monthly rates and flexible cancellation</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Our results:</strong> Expedia contributes 10-30% of revenue for business and family-oriented properties. For urban studios, Expedia delivers minimal value (we focus on Airbnb instead).</p>

      <td>RM2,500-3,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Airbnb + Expedia</strong></td>
      <td><strong>RM11,000-11,500</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Diversification bonus:</strong> RM2,000-2,500/month extra (22-28% increase) for minimal added effort.</p>

<h2>Recommendation: Add Expedia for Specific Properties</h2>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Expedia isn't for every property. But for business-friendly or family-oriented 2BR+ properties, Expedia adds 20-30% more revenue.</p>

<p><strong>List on Expedia if:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Property has 2+ bedrooms</li>
  <td>Located near business district (Melaka Raya, malls)</li>
  <td>Has desk/work space (business travelers)</li>
  <td>Has family amenities (kitchen, laundry, parking)</li>
  <td>You want corporate traveler segment</td>
</ul>

<p><strong>Skip Expedia if:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Property is studio / 1BR</li>
  <td>Located in heritage zone (Jonker Walk)</td>
  <td>Targeting younger, budget-conscious guests</li>
  <td>Property has unique/quirky features (Expedia guests prefer standard)</td>
</ul>
