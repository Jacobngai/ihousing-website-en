<h1>iHousing vs Competitors: Setup Fee Comparison Breakdown</h1>

<h2>Why Do Management Companies Charge Setup Fees?</h2>

<p>Setup fees are the first sign of how a company operates. At iHousing, we've analyzed 20+ Airbnb management companies in Melaka. The setup fee landscape is a maze of hidden charges, vague policies, and unexpected costs.</p>

<p>Here's exactly what you should expect—and why iHousing's approach is different.</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Most companies don't reveal total costs upfront. They highlight low setup fees, then charge add-ons.</p>

<h2>iHousing Setup Fee: RM0</h2>

<p>We charge nothing upfront. No setup fee. No hidden add-ons. No surprises.</p>

<p>Why? Three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>We invest in our shared success:</strong> Our profit comes from monthly management fees. We shouldn't profit before you do.</li>
<li><strong>Barrier reduction:</strong> We want to make it easy to try iHousing. No upfront risk for you.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence in service:</strong> Our performance should sell itself, not marketing gimmicks.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Value:</strong> RM1,400-2,850 in services included free with iHousing.</p>

<h2>Hidden Setup Costs: What to Watch For</h2>

<h3>Photography Bait-and-Switch</h3>

<p><strong>The pitch:</strong> "Professional photography included!"</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> They send someone with an iPhone, take 10 quick photos, and call it "professional."</p>

<p><strong>Real pro photos cost:</strong> RM400-800 for 20+ edited images, proper lighting, staging.</p>

<p><strong>How to verify:</strong> Ask for equipment list (camera, lenses, lighting), ask for portfolio, request sample photos.</p>

<h3>Platform Registration Per-Site Charges</h3>

<p><strong>The pitch:</strong> "We'll list you everywhere!"</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> They charge RM100-300 PER PLATFORM. Airbnb = RM150. Booking.com = RM200. Agoda = RM150. VRBO = RM200. Expedia = RM200.</p>

<p><strong>Total:</strong> RM900 for 5 platforms.</p>

<p><strong>iHousing:</strong> All 5 platforms included. No per-platform charges.</p>

<h3>"Required" Smart Lock Upgrades</h3>

<p><strong>The pitch:</strong> "You need our smart lock system for security. RM500 setup fee."</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Basic smart locks cost RM200. They're charging RM300 for "setup" (configuration that takes 10 minutes).</p>

<p><strong>iHousing:</strong> You buy the lock (RM200). We handle setup (free). You own the hardware.</p>

<h3>Furnishing Consultation That's Actually Sales Pitch</h3>

<p><strong>The pitch:</strong> "Furniture consultation RM500. We'll design your space."</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> They give generic advice, then recommend "preferred suppliers" who pay them commission.</p>

<p><strong>iHousing:</strong> Free design consultation. No supplier kickbacks. Honest advice on what works.</p>

<h2>Setup Fee vs. Ongoing Value: The Real Comparison</h2>

<p>Setup fees are one-time. Monthly fees are recurring. Which matters more?</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Scenario</th>
<th>Company A (RM2,000 setup, 20% commission)</th>
<th>iHousing (RM0 setup, RM250 flat)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Month 1 (RM5,000 revenue)</td>
<td>You pay: RM2,000 setup + RM1,000 commission = RM3,000</td>
<td>You pay: RM250 flat fee = RM250</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Month 6 (RM8,000 revenue)</td>
<td>You pay: RM1,600 commission</td>
<td>You pay: RM250 flat fee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Month 12 (RM10,000 revenue)</td>
<td>You pay: RM2,000 commission</td>
<td>You pay: RM250 flat fee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Year 1 total</strong></td>
<td><strong>RM19,600</strong></td>
<td><strong>RM3,000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Savings with iHousing:</strong> RM16,600 in first year alone.</p>

<p>And that's assuming Company A delivers results. What if they don't?</p>

<h2>The Setup Fee Refund Myth</h2>

<p>Some companies offer: "Money-back guarantee if not satisfied in 90 days."</p>

<p>Here's the fine print they don't mention:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Refund processing time:</strong> 60-90 days to process</li>
<li><strong>"Not satisfied" definition:</strong> Must meet specific criteria (minimum bookings, specific review scores)</li>
<li><strong>Non-refundable portions:</strong> Photography, platform fees, "administrative costs" deducted from refund</li>
<li><strong>Actual refund:</strong> Typically 30-50% of setup fee, not 100%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>iHousing approach:</strong> No setup fee = nothing to refund. Cancel anytime with 30 days notice. No penalties.</p>

<h2>What iHousing Does Before Your First Guest</h2>

<p>Even with RM0 setup fee, we invest significant resources in onboarding:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Property visit:</strong> 1-2 hours to assess space, identify improvements</li>
<li><strong>Photography coordination:</strong> Professional photographer booking, art direction</li>
<li><strong>Listing creation:</strong> 5 platforms, optimized content, strategic pricing</li>
<li><strong>Guest communication setup:</strong> Templates, auto-replies, FAQ development</li>
<li><strong>Service provider vetting:</strong> Cleaning, maintenance, emergency contacts</li>
<li><strong>Calendar synchronization:</strong> Multi-platform integration to prevent double bookings</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Value:</strong> RM2,000-3,000 in time/resources invested by iHousing before first booking.</p>

<p>Why do we absorb this cost? Because we recoup it through long-term relationships, not upfront fees.</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Only 10% of companies offer RM0 setup. iHousing is one of them.</p>

<h2>The Real Test: Performance Guarantee</h2>

<p>Setup fees are risk-free for companies. They get paid whether you succeed or not.</p>

<p>iHousing assumes the risk:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RM0 setup:</strong> We invest before earning</li>
<li><strong>Performance basis:</strong> We only profit if your property performs</li>
<li><strong>Cancellation flexibility:</strong> Leave with 30 days notice, no penalties</li>
</ul>

<p>Some competitors say: "Our high setup fee shows commitment."</p>

<p>We say: "Our RM0 setup fee shows confidence in our ability to deliver results."</p>

<h2>Questions to Ask Any Management Company About Setup Fees</h2>

<p>Before signing anything, ask:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>"What's the TOTAL one-time cost before my first guest?"</strong> (Get written quote)</li>
<li><strong>"What does photography include—equipment, number of photos, editing?"</strong></li>
<li><strong>"Do you charge per platform? How many platforms will I be on?"</strong></li>
<li><strong>"Is the setup fee refundable? What are the exact conditions?"</strong></li>
<li><strong>"What happens if I cancel within 6 months? Do I get any refund?"</strong></li>
<li><strong>"Are there any mandatory purchases I must make (smart locks, linens, supplies)?"</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>iHousing answers:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>RM0 total</li>
<li>Professional photographer, 20+ edited images, full equipment list provided</li>
<li>5 platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com, Agoda, VRBO, Expedia), no per-platform charges</li>
<li>N/A (no setup fee to refund)</li>
<li>Cancel anytime with 30 days notice</li>
<li>None required (though we may recommend upgrades)</li>
</ol>
