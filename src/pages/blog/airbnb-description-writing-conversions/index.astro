<h2>The Perfect Structure</h2>

<p>Proven description structure that converts:</p>

<p><strong>1. Headline (5-7 words)</strong></p>
<p>✓ "Stunning Jonker Walk Heritage House - UNESCO View"</p>
<p>✗ "Nice House in Melaka"</p>

<p><strong>2. Opening Hook (2-3 sentences)</strong></p>
<p>Start with emotion and experience, not features:</p>
<p>✓ "Wake up to the call to prayer from nearby Kampung Kling Mosque and sip coffee on your private balcony overlooking Melaka's historic shophouses. This meticulously restored 1920s Peranakan terrace house immerses you in 500 years of multicultural heritage."</p>

<p>✗ "This house has 3 bedrooms and is located near Jonker Street."</p>

<p><strong>3. Space Overview (3-4 sentences)</strong></p>
<p>Highlight the unique value proposition:</p>
<p>✓ "Unlike modern condos, this heritage home offers authentic architectural details - intricate floor tiles, carved timber doors, and an open-air courtyard. Modern amenities are seamlessly integrated: air conditioning in bedrooms, high-speed WiFi, and a fully equipped kitchen where you can prepare Nyonya dishes with local spices from the morning market."</p>

<p><strong>4. Room-by-Room Details</strong></p>
<p>Walk guests through each space:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Master Bedroom:</strong> Queen bed, AC, blackout curtains, heritage views</li>
  <li><strong>Second Bedroom:</strong> 2 single beds, AC, quiet street view</li>
  <li><strong>Living Area:</strong> Comfortable seating, Smart TV, Netflix, sound system</li>
  <li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Full stove, refrigerator, cooking basics, espresso machine</li>
  <li><strong>Bathroom:</strong> Hot water, rain shower, premium toiletries, hairdryer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Location & Experiences</strong></p>
<p>Paint the local scene:</p>
<p>✓ "Step outside and you're in the heart of Melaka's UNESCO World Heritage Site. Jonker Walk's night market (Fri-Sun) starts at your doorstep. Famous chicken rice ball shops, Nyonya restaurants, and artisan cafes are within 2 minutes walk. The Straits of China coastline is a 10-minute stroll for sunset walks."</p>

<p><strong>6. Guest Access</strong></p>
<p>Clarify what's included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Entire house (private, not shared)</li>
  <li>Self check-in with smart lock</li>
  <li>Free covered parking for 1 car</li>
  <li>Portable WiFi hotspot for exploring</li>
  <li>Nespresso machine with pods provided</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Other Things to Note</strong></p>
<p>Set expectations proactively:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heritage house has character (some uneven floors, charming quirks)</li>
  <li>Friday-Saturday street music until 11PM (part of the experience!)</li>
  <li>Stairs to bedrooms (not suitable for mobility issues)</li>
  <li>No smoking inside (balcony available)</li>
</ul>
