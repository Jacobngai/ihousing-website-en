<ul>
<li>Peace of mind</li></ul>

<strong>This guide shows you exactly how to evaluate and choose the right Airbnb property manager in Malaysia.</strong>

<h2>Step 1: Define Your Priorities</h2>

<h3>What Matters Most to You?</h3>

<strong>Before interviewing managers, clarify your goals:</strong>

<strong>Why This Matters:</strong>
<p>Different managers excel at different things. Knowing your priorities helps you choose the right fit.</p>

<strong>Example Profiles:</strong>

<strong>The "Maximize Income" Owner:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Priority: Highest possible revenue</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Trade-offs: Willing to pay higher fees for better performance</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Best Manager: Results-focused, proven track record, premium pricing</li></ul>

<strong>The "Hands-Off" Owner:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Priority: Zero involvement, zero stress</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Trade-offs: Okay with slightly lower revenue for complete peace of mind</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Best Manager: Full-service, responsive, transparent reporting</li></ul>

<strong>The "Portfolio Builder":</strong>
<ul>
<li>Priority: Scalability, consistency across properties</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Trade-offs: Willing to commit longer-term for right partner</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Best Manager: Established, multiple condos, scalable systems</li></ul>

<h2>Step 2: Initial Screening (Do This BEFORE Meeting)</h2>

<h3>Online Presence Check</h3>

<strong>Red Flags at First Glance:</strong>

<strong>Green Flags:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Professional website with clear services</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Transparent pricing (or clear "contact for quote")</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Specific property examples (which condos they manage)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Verifiable testimonials</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Active social media with guest reviews</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Professional photos of managed properties</li></ul>

<h3>Portfolio Size Check</h3>

<strong>Ask (or check online):</strong>
<ul>
<li>"How many properties do you manage?"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"How long have you been operating?"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"Which condos/areas do you cover?"</li></ul>

<strong>Green Flags:</strong>
<ul>
<li>50+ properties</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>3+ years in operation</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Multiple locations/condos</li></ul>

<strong>Red Flags:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"We're launching soon" (unproven)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>5-10 properties (too small for efficiency)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>1-2 years experience (may not survive downturn)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Only 1 condo (limited market knowledge)</li></ul>

<strong>Ideal:</strong> 50+ properties, 3+ years, multiple locations

<h2>Step 3: The Interview (Questions to Ask)</h2>

<h3>Category 1: Performance & Track Record</h3>

<strong>Q1: "What is your average occupancy rate?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "We achieve 60%+ average occupancy across our portfolio. For similar 2-bedroom units in [Your Condo], we're seeing 35-40%."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "We maximize occupancy" or "It depends on the property" (vague, hiding poor performance)

<strong>Q2: "Can you show performance data from properties similar to mine?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "Absolutely. Here's a 2-bedroom in Silverscape we manage: [shows data with occupancy, revenue, expenses]."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "We don't share client data" or "Every property is different" (avoiding transparency)

<strong>Q3: "What is your typical guest review score?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "Our average is 4.8/5 across all properties. Here are some recent guest reviews."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "Mostly 5-star" or "Great reviews" (no specific data)

<h3>Category 2: Fees & Pricing Structure</h3>

<strong>Q4: "What is your EXACT management fee? Are there ANY other fees?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "We charge [specific amount or %]. This includes [list what's included]. There are no other fees except [specific exceptions]."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "We're competitive" or "Plus standard expenses" (vague, hidden costs coming)

<strong>Q5: "Do you markup cleaning or maintenance costs?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "No markup. We pass through actual costs. Or: We have in-house cleaning so no markup."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "Standard industry markup" or "A small admin fee" (hidden cost)

<strong>Q6: "Who pays platform fees (Airbnb, Booking.com)?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "Platform fees are charged to you, usually 3% per booking. We'll itemize this in your monthly statement."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> Unclear or doesn't mention it (likely passing through to you without disclosure)

<h3>Category 3: Services & Operations</h3>

<strong>Q7: "What platforms do you list on?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "We list on 5 platforms: Airbnb, Booking.com, Agoda, VRBO, and Expedia with automated calendar sync."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "Mostly Airbnb" or "We use the major platforms" (likely 1-2 platforms only)

<strong>Q8: "What is your response time for guest inquiries?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "We respond within 1 hour during business hours, 4 hours maximum responsive."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "Within 24 hours" (too slow - guests book elsewhere)

<strong>Q9: "Do you provide professional photography?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "Yes, included in our setup. We have a professional photographer we work with."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "Optional extra" or "We can help arrange" (not included = extra cost RM800-1,500)

<strong>Q10: "How do you handle cleaning and maintenance?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "We have an in-house cleaning team for consistency. For maintenance, we coordinate trusted contractors and don't markup costs."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "We arrange third-party services" (markup likely) or vague about process

<h3>Category 4: Contract & Exit Terms</h3>

<strong>Q11: "What is the contract length?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "12 months standard."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "24 months" or "Minimum 18 months" (long lock-in)

<strong>Q12: "Can I terminate early? Under what terms?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "Yes, with 30-day written notice. No penalty."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "Early termination fee of RM5,000" or "Contract is binding for full term" (trapped)

<strong>Q13: "What happens to my existing bookings if I switch managers?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "We honor all existing reservations and ensure smooth transition. No guest disruption."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> Unclear or "we'll discuss it" (potential booking loss)

<h3>Category 5: References & Verification</h3>

<strong>Q14: "Can I speak to 2-3 existing owners?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "Absolutely. Here are contact details for owners with properties similar to yours."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "Our clients prefer privacy" (hiding poor performance)

<strong>Q15: "Can I visit a managed property?"</strong>

<strong>Good Answer:</strong> "Yes, we can arrange a viewing. We have several owners who allow this."

<strong>Red Flag Answer:</strong> "We don't do property visits" (what are they hiding?)

<h2>Step 4: Reference Checking (Do This!)</h2>

<h3>Why References Matter</h3>

<strong>Online reviews can be faked.</strong>
<strong>Direct owner conversations cannot.</strong>

<strong>What to Ask Owners:</strong>

<strong>Performance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"What occupancy rate are you achieving?"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"How does this compare to when you managed yourself (if applicable)?"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"Have you had any issues with the manager?"</li></ul>

<strong>Service Quality:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"How responsive are they to issues?"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"How's the cleaning quality?"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"Any surprises in fees or costs?"</li></ul>

<strong>Overall Satisfaction:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Would you recommend this manager?"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"What's their biggest strength?"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"What's their biggest weakness?"</li></ul>

<strong>Red Flags from Owners:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hesitation to recommend</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Vague praise ("they're nice" vs. "they achieved 65% occupancy")</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Complaints about hidden fees</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Poor communication stories</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Difficulties leaving the contract</li></ul>

<h2>Step 5: The Proposal Evaluation</h2>

<h3>What Should Be Included</h3>

<strong>A professional manager's proposal should include:</strong>

<strong>1. Performance Projection</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expected occupancy rate</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Expected daily rate</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Expected annual revenue</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Comparison to market average</li></ul>

<strong>2. Fee Breakdown</strong>
<ul>
<li>Exact management fee</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Any additional costs</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>What's included vs. extra</li></ul>

<strong>3. Services Detail</strong>
<ul>
<li>Setup process (if applicable)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Ongoing services</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Reporting frequency</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Communication channels</li></ul>

<strong>4. Contract Summary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Term length</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Termination terms</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Performance clauses (if any)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Exclusivity requirements</li></ul>

<strong>5. Timeline</strong>
<ul>
<li>When they can start</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Setup timeframe</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>First booking expectations</li></ul>

<h3>Red Flags in Proposals</h3>

<strong>Vague Projections:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"We'll maximize your revenue" (no numbers)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"Above-market occupancy" (unsubstantiated)</li></ul>

<strong>Hidden Fees:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Plus standard expenses" (what are they?)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"Admin fees may apply" (how much?)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Cleaning/markup not mentioned (they're there)</li></ul>

<strong>Unrealistic Promises:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"90% occupancy guaranteed" (impossible, lying)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"Double your revenue overnight" (unrealistic)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"No vacancy ever" (impossible)</li></ul>

<strong>Poor Presentation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Typos, formatting errors</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Unprofessional appearance</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Missing key information</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Template-like, not customized</li></ul>

<h2>Step 6: The Final Decision Framework</h2>

<h3>Scorecard Approach</h3>

<strong>Rate each manager on these criteria (1-5 scale):</strong>

<strong>Calculate weighted scores. Highest wins.</strong>

<h3>When to Choose Flat Fee vs. Commission</h3>

<strong>Flat Fee (Like iHousing Parkland):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Know exact cost, no revenue sharing, higher net income</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Manager takes risk if occupancy low</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Best For:</strong> Properties with good occupancy potential, owners wanting cost certainty</li></ul>

<strong>Commission-Based:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Manager motivated to maximize revenue</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Uncertain monthly costs, fees grow with revenue</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Best For:</strong> Higher-end properties, owners wanting performance-based fee</li></ul>

<strong>iHousing Hybrid:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Parkland: Flat fee (predictable)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Other condos: Custom quotes (tailored to property)</li></ul>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<h3>Mistake #1: Choosing Based on Lowest Fee</h3>

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Manager A: 15% commission, 19% occupancy</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Manager B: 25% commission, 35% occupancy</li></ul>

<strong>RM70,000 Revenue Scenario:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Manager A: RM70,000 - RM10,500 fee = RM59,500</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Manager B: RM70,000 - RM17,500 fee = RM52,500</li></ul>

<strong>Wait:</strong> Manager B achieves HIGHER occupancy, so:
<ul>
<li>Manager A actual: RM35,000 revenue - RM5,250 = RM29,750</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Manager B actual: RM70,000 revenue - RM17,500 = RM52,500</li></ul>

<strong>Winner:</strong> Higher-fee Manager B = RM22,750 MORE net income

<strong>Lesson:</strong> Focus on NET income, not fee percentage.

<h3>Mistake #2: Not Verifying Performance</h3>

<strong>What Managers Claim:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"We achieve high occupancy"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"Our owners are very happy"</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>"Great returns"</li></ul>

<strong>What You Should Verify:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Actual occupancy numbers</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Real owner testimonials (contact them)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Specific property examples</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Performance data with proof</li></ul>

<strong>If They Won't Provide Data:</strong> Walk away.

<h3>Mistake #3: Ignoring Contract Terms</h3>

<strong>Dangerous Clauses:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Automatic renewal (traps you for years)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Early termination penalties (RM5,000+ to leave)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Performance minimums not met (they still get paid)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Ownership of listings (if you leave, you lose everything)</li></ul>

<strong>Safe Contract Terms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>12-month maximum</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>30-day notice to terminate</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>No penalties for leaving</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Performance-based exit option (if they underperform)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>You own your listings</li></ul>

<h3>Mistake #4: Not Testing Service First</h3>

<strong>Before Committing, Test:</strong>
<li><strong>WhatsApp them</strong> - how fast is response?</li>
<li><strong>Ask for data</strong> - do they provide specific numbers?</li>
<li><strong>Request references</strong> - do they share owner contacts?</li>
<li><strong>Visit a property</strong> - are they transparent?</li>

<strong>If They Fail These Tests:</strong> Don't sign.

<h3>Mistake #5: Signing Long Contracts Initially</h3>

<strong>Never sign 24+ months upfront.</strong>

<strong>Why:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You don't know if they'll deliver</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>You're trapped if they underperform</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Exit is difficult/expensive</li></ul>

<strong>Better Approach:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Start with 12 months</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Renew if happy</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Leave if not</li></ul>
