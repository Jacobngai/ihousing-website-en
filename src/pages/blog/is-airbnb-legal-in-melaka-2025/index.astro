<h1>Is Airbnb Legal in Melaka 2026? YES — MOTAC Rules, STR Laws & Condo Guide</h1>
        <strong>Short Answer: YES, Airbnb is legal in Melaka in 2025.</strong>
        <p>Unlike Selangor's restrictive 6-month rule, Melaka has <strong>no specific laws prohibiting short-term rentals</strong>. This makes Melaka one of the most Airbnb-friendly states in Malaysia.</p>
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h2>Quick Summary: Melaka vs Other States</h2>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>State</th><th>Airbnb Legal?</th><th>Restrictions</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>**Melaka**</td><td>✅ YES</td><td>None</td><td>No specific STR laws yet</td></tr>

        <strong>Melaka Advantage:</strong> No minimum stay requirement. You can rent nightly, weekly, or monthly - whatever maximizes your income.
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h2>Understanding Melaka's Regulatory Status (2025)</h2>
        <h3>Current Legal Status</h3>
        <p>As of February 2026:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>No State-Level Ban</strong>: Melaka state government has not enacted laws prohibiting short-term rentals</li>
        <li><strong>No Licensing Required</strong>: Unlike hotels, Airbnb condos don't need tourism licenses (yet)</li>
        <li><strong>No Minimum Stay</strong>: Unlike Selangor, you can accept 1-night bookings</li>
        <li><strong>No Income Cap</strong>: Earn as much as your property can generate</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What's Coming? (Future Regulations)</h3>
        <p>The Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MOTAC) has <strong>discussed</strong> requiring STR licenses, but:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Not yet implemented</strong> as of 2026</li>
        <li>Would apply nationwide, not Melaka-specific</li>
        <li>Likely to focus on <strong>registration</strong> rather than prohibition</li>
        <li>Grandfathering expected for existing hosts</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Start now while regulations are still friendly. Future hosts may face stricter requirements.
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h2>Condo vs Landed Property: Different Rules</h2>
        <h3>Strata-Titled Condos (Apartments, Service Residences)</h3>
        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Each condo's management corporation sets its own rules.
        <strong>Common Condo Restrictions:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>No commercial activity (Airbnb may fall under this)</li>
        <li>Minimum rental period (30 days, 6 months, etc.)</li>
        <li>Guest registration requirements</li>
        <li>Parking limitations</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Airbnb-Friendly Condos in Melaka:</strong>
        <p>We manage 10+ condos that <strong>allow short-term rentals</strong>, including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Silverscape Residence</li>
        <li>The Shore Residence</li>
        <li>Imperio Residence</li>
        <li>Ong Kim Wee Residence</li>
        <li>Novo 8 Residence</li>
        <li>Century Mahkota Hotel Residence</li>
        <li>And more...</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Before Buying:</strong> Always check with the building management if Airbnb is allowed. We can help verify this for condos we manage.
        <h3>Landed Properties (Terrace Houses, Bungalows)</h3>
        <strong>Easier Rules:</strong> Landed properties typically have fewer restrictions:
        <ul>
        <li>No strata management to deal with</li>
        <li>No condo committee approval needed</li>
        <li>More freedom to operate</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Lower occupancy compared to prime condo locations near Jonker Street.
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h2>What If Your Condo Bans Airbnb?</h2>
        <strong>Don't panic.</strong> You have options:
        <h3>Option 1: Petition for Rule Change</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Gather support from other owners</li>
        <li>Present data on security benefits (short-term = more eyes on property)</li>
        <li>Show how it increases property values</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Option 2: Switch to Long-Term Rental</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Less income but guaranteed cash flow</li>
        <li>6-12 month leases</li>
        <li>We can help with tenant placement</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Option 3: Sell and Buy Airbnb-Friendly Property</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>We can recommend condos that allow STR</li>
        <li>Calculate ROI before buying</li>
        <li>Avoid costly mistakes</li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h2>Compliance Checklist (What You SHOULD Do)</h2>
        <p>Even without strict regulations, follow these best practices:</p>
        <h3>1. Inform Your Condo Management</h3>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h2>Melaka vs Selangor: Why Melaka Wins</h2>
        <strong>Selangor's 6-Month Rule:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Must rent minimum 6 months at a time</li>
        <li>Airbnb essentially banned for short stays</li>
        <li>Drastically reduces income potential</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Example (Selangor vs Melaka):</strong>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Selangor (6-month rental)</th><th>Melaka (Airbnb)</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Monthly Rate</td><td>RM 2,000</td><td>RM 3,000 (avg)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Occupancy</td><td>100% (6-month lease)</td><td>60% (weekends + holidays)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Annual Income</td><td>RM 24,000</td><td>RM 36,000+</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Flexibility</td><td>Low (locked in)</td><td>High (use property anytime)</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <strong>Winner:</strong> Melaka earns <strong>50% more</strong> with greater flexibility.
