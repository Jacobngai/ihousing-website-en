<h1>Freeport Trade Zone Melaka: Shopping Tourism Investment Opportunity for Airbnb Owners</h1>

<p>Located in Alor Gajah, Freeport Trade Zone Melaka has emerged as one of the state's most powerful tourism magnets. For property investors, this presents a significant opportunity: <strong>strategically positioned Airbnb properties can capture steady demand from Singaporean shoppers seeking weekend getaways.</strong></p>

<p>At iHousing Melaka, we've seen properties near Freeport Trade Zone maintain 65-75% occupancy year-round, driven primarily by repeat visitors from Singapore who come specifically for shopping tourism. Let's analyze why this location works and how to maximize your investment.</p>
