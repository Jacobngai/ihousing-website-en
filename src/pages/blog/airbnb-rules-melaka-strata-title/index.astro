<h1>Airbnb Rules in Melaka: Strata Title, Condo Regulations & What You Must Know</h1>
        <h2>Can You Legally Run Airbnb in Your Melaka Condo? (The Answer Might Surprise You)</h2>
        <p>You're excited to start Airbnb hosting in your Melaka condo. You've done the math:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>RM20,000+ annual revenue potential</li>
        <li>Better than long-term rental returns</li>
        <li>Professional management makes it hands-free</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But then the doubts creep in:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>"Is Airbnb actually legal in Melaka?"</strong></li>
        <li><strong>"Does my condo's strata title allow short-term rentals?"</strong></li>
        <li><strong>"Will building management shut me down?"</strong></li>
        <li><strong>"What are the regulations I need to follow?"</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You're right to be concerned. The rules around Airbnb in Malaysia are complex, and <strong>what's allowed in Kuala Lumpur might not apply in Melaka</strong>.</p>
        <p>This guide breaks down exactly what's legal, what's grey area, and how to ensure your Airbnb operates within the rules in Melaka.</p>
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h2>The Current Legal Status of Airbnb in Melaka (2025)</h2>
        <h3>Good News: Melaka Has No Specific Airbnb Ban (Yet)</h3>
        <p>Unlike Penang and Selangor, which have implemented strict regulations, <strong>Melaka currently has no specific laws prohibiting short-term rentals</strong>.</p>

        <li>No minimum rental period enforced</li>
        <li>No quota system for STRs</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>However:</strong> This doesn't mean you can operate without restrictions. There are other rules that apply.
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h3>Federal Regulations That Apply</h3>
        <p>While Melaka has no specific Airbnb laws, federal regulations still apply:</p>

        <hr class="my-8">
        <h2>The Critical Issue: Your Condo's Strata Title Rules</h2>
        <strong>This is where most Airbnb hosts get into trouble.</strong> Your condo's strata title and building bylaws can restrict or prohibit short-term rentals, even if Melaka state allows them.
        <h3>What Is Strata Title?</h3>
        <strong>Strata title</strong> is the legal ownership of a "lot" (your unit) within a larger building, plus shared ownership of common property.
        <strong>What this means:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>You own your unit outright</li>
        <li>You share ownership of common areas (pool, gym, lobby)</li>
        <li>You're bound by the building's rules (bylaws)</li>
        <li>Management corporation enforces these rules</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Key point:</strong> Your strata title can restrict how you use your property, including prohibiting Airbnb.
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h3>How to Check Your Condo's Airbnb Rules</h3>
        <strong>Step 1: Review Your Strata Title Deed</strong>
        <p>Look for:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage restrictions:</strong> Some deeds specify "residential use only"</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial activity bans:</strong> Some prohibit business activities</li>
        <li><strong>Short-term rental clauses:</strong> Some explicitly ban rentals under 6 months</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Where to find it:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Your sale and purchase agreement</li>
        <li>Your strata title document</li>
        <li>Your lawyer (if you don't have it)</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Step 2: Review Building Bylaws</strong>
        <p>Every condo has bylaws that govern:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What activities are allowed</li>
        <li>Noise and behavior rules</li>
        <li>Guest access policies</li>
        <li>Commercial use restrictions</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>What to look for:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>"No short-term rentals" clause:</strong> Explicit ban</li>
        <li><strong>"No commercial activity" clause:</strong> Could apply to Airbnb</li>
        <li><strong>"Guest registration" requirement:</strong> Must notify management</li>
        <li><strong>"Minimum rental period" clause:</strong> Must rent 3+ months, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Where to find it:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Building management office</li>
        <li>Strata management corporation</li>
        <li>Your condo's resident handbook</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Step 3: Ask Building Management Directly</strong>
        <strong>Questions to ask:</strong>
        <ol>
        <li>"Does the condo allow short-term rentals (Airbnb, Booking.com)?"</li>
        <li>"Are there restrictions on minimum rental period?"</li>
        <li>"Do I need to register or get permission for Airbnb?"</li>
        <li>"Are there rules about guest access or registration?"</li>
        <li>"Are additional fees charged for short-term rentals?"</li>
        <li>"Have any owners had issues with Airbnb operations?"</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Get answers in writing</strong> (email or letter) to protect yourself.
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h3>Common Strata Title Restrictions</h3>
        <strong>Restriction Type #1: Explicit Ban</strong>
        <strong>Example bylaw:</strong>
        <p>> "No unit shall be used for short-term rental accommodation, defined as rentals of less than 30 days."</p>

        <strong>Grey area:</strong> Is Airbnb "commercial activity"?
        <strong>Interpretation varies:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Some buildings consider Airbnb commercial (banned)</li>
        <li>Some consider it investment activity (allowed)</li>
        <li><strong>Get written clarification from management</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="my-8">
        <strong>Restriction Type #3: Guest Registration</strong>

        <strong>Solution:</strong> Register guests with management as required.
        <hr class="my-8">
        <strong>Restriction Type #4: Minimum Rental Period</strong>
        <strong>Example bylaw:</strong>
        <p>> "Minimum rental period is 3 months."</p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Short-term Airbnb is prohibited.
        <strong>Alternative:</strong> Consider mid-term rentals (1-3 months).
        <hr class="my-8">
        <strong>Restriction Type #5: Additional Fees</strong>
        <strong>Example policy:</strong>
        <p>> "Short-term rental units are charged RM100/month additional maintenance."</p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Higher operating costs.
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Factor this into your pricing.

        <h3>Grey Area #1: "Is Airbnb Commercial Activity?"</h3>
        <strong>The debate:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Argument for "no":</strong> It's investment rental activity, not a business</li>
        <li><strong>Argument for "yes":</strong> You're providing accommodation services (commercial)</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>How to handle:</strong>
        <ol>
        <li>Check your strata deed's definition of "commercial"</li>
        <li>Get written clarification from management</li>
        <li>If banned, consider mid-term rentals (1-3 months)</li>
        </ol>
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h3>Grey Area #2: "Can I Use a Management Company to Get Around Restrictions?"</h3>
        <strong>The question:</strong> If Airbnb is banned, can a professional manager operate it?
        <strong>The answer:</strong> No. If the building prohibits short-term rentals, it doesn't matter who manages it. The restriction is on the ACTIVITY, not the operator.
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Get approval for STR first</li>
        <li>Then hire management company</li>
        <li>Or choose a different building that allows STR</li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h3>Grey Area #3: "What If I Only Rent to Family/Friends?"</h3>
        <strong>The question:</strong> If I only rent to people I know, is it still Airbnb?
        <strong>The reality:</strong> If you're listing on platforms and accepting payment from strangers, it's a short-term rental. Personal connections don't change the nature of the transaction.
        <strong>Better approach:</strong> Get proper approval if you're going to rent at all.

        <h2>Future Regulations: What's Coming?</h2>
        <h3>National Short-Term Rental Framework (Expected 2025-2026)</h3>
        <p>The Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MOTAC) is developing:</p>
        <strong>Expected requirements:</strong>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Mandatory registration</strong> with MOTAC</li>
        <li><strong>Safety standards:</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li>Fire extinguisher</li>
        <li>Smoke detectors</li>
        <li>First aid kit</li>
        <li>Emergency exits</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Insurance requirements:</strong> Minimum coverage amounts</li>
        <li><strong>Guest reporting:</strong> Provide guest info to authorities</li>
        <li><strong>Regular inspections:</strong> Compliance checks</li>
        <li><strong>Fee structure:</strong> Annual registration fee</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Timeline:</strong> Framework expected 2025, implementation 2026.
        <strong>What this means for you:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Start preparing now (safety upgrades, insurance)</li>
        <li>Budget for registration fees</li>
        <li>Expect additional compliance requirements</li>
        <li>Professional managers will handle compliance for you</li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="my-8">
        <h3>State-Level Regulations (Selangor Model May Spread)</h3>
        <p>Selangor has implemented:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>6-month minimum rental period</li>
        <li>Registration with state authorities</li>
        <li>Quotas on STRs per building</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Could Melaka follow?</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Possible (if STR problems increase)</li>
        <li>Not imminent (Melaka pro-tourism)</li>
        <li>Monitor developments</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>How to prepare:</strong>

        <li>Join Melaka Airbnb host associations</li>
