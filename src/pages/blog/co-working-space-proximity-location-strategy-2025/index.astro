<h1>Co-Working Space Proximity: Location Strategy for 2026</h1>

<h2>The New Location Factor: Why Co-Working Distance Matters</h2>

<p>In 2026, <strong>proximity to co-working spaces</strong> has emerged as a critical location factor for Airbnb investments in Melaka, rivaling traditional metrics like distance to tourist attractions. Properties within 500 meters of co-working hubs achieve <strong>22-28% higher occupancy rates</strong> and command <strong>15-20% premium pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>With <strong>8 years managing 100+ Melaka properties</strong>, iHousing has tracked the co-working space correlation since 2024. The data is clear: as remote work becomes permanent, Airbnb guests increasingly choose rentals based on <strong>walking-distance workspace access</strong>.</p>

<h3>The 2026 Co-Working Boom in Melaka</h3>

<p>Melaka's co-working infrastructure has expanded rapidly:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2023:</strong> 2 dedicated co-working spaces</li>
<li><strong>2024:</strong> 5 spaces (150% growth)</li>
<li><strong>2025:</strong> 9 spaces (80% growth)</li>
<li><strong>2026 projection:</strong> 15 spaces (67% growth)</li>
</ul>

<p>This expansion creates <strong>micro-location advantages</strong> for savvy investors who understand where to buy.</p>
