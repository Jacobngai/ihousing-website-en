<h1>Hidden Costs of Airbnb Management: What Most Companies Don't Tell You</h1>

<h2>The 20% Commission Is Just the Beginning</h2>

<p>When you hire an Airbnb management company charging 20% commission, you expect to pay 20% of your revenue in fees. Simple, transparent, fair - right?</p>

<p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

<p>What most management companies don't tell you is that commission is just <strong>one piece of their revenue puzzle</strong>. The real money comes from hidden markups and fees that can add <strong>another 5-10% to your effective management rate</strong>.</p>

<p>After analyzing statements from 100+ properties that switched to iHousing, we've identified <strong>7 hidden revenue streams</strong> that commission-based managers use to pad their profits.</p>

<h2>Hidden Cost #1: Cleaning Markup (30-50% Margin)</h2>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Your manager says: "We include professional cleaning after every guest checkout."</p>

<p>What they don't say: "We mark up the cleaning cost by 30-50% and pocket the difference."</p>

<p><strong>Real example from our client who switched:</strong></p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Actual Cost</th>
      <th>What They Charged</th>
      <th>Markup</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Cleaning fee per stay</strong></td>
      <td>RM80 (cleaner rate)</td>
      <td>RM120 (on your statement)</td>
      <td><strong>+50%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Annual impact (40 stays/year):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual cleaning cost: RM3,200</li>
  <li>What you paid: RM4,800</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden profit to manager: RM1,600/year</strong></li>
  <li><strong>3-year cost: RM4,800</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why they do it:</strong> Cleaning is the most frequent expense. A small markup on every stay adds up to thousands per year.</p>

<p><strong>Flat fee advantage:</strong> iHousing employs our own cleaning team. You pay actual cost only. No markup.</p>

<h2>Hidden Cost #2: Maintenance Margin (15-25%)</h2>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Your manager says: "We coordinate all maintenance and repairs for you."</p>

<p>What they don't say: "We add 15-25% to every contractor bill as our 'coordination fee.'"</p>

<p><strong>Real example:</strong></p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Service</th>
      <th>Contractor Bill</th>
      <th>What You Paid</th>
      <td>Margin</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Plumbing repair</strong></td>
      <td>RM300</td>
      <td>RM360</td>
      <td><strong>20%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Aircon servicing</strong></td>
      <td>RM150</td>
      <td>RM180</td>
      <td><strong>20%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Electrical work</strong></td>
      <td>RM200</td>
      <td>RM250</td>
      <td><strong>25%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Annual impact (avg RM800/year maintenance):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual cost: RM800</li>
  <li>What you paid: RM960-1,000</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden profit: RM160-200/year</strong></li>
  <li><strong>3-year cost: RM480-600</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why they do it:</strong> Maintenance is unpredictable. Adding margin ensures they profit from every repair.</p>

<p><strong>Flat fee advantage:</strong> We coordinate maintenance but you pay contractors directly. No margin.</p>

<h2>Hidden Cost #3: Supply Markups (15-30%)</h2>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Your manager says: "We keep your property stocked with essentials."</p>

<p>What they don't say: "We charge 15-30% above retail on toilet paper, soap, linens, and other supplies."</p>

<p><strong>Real example:</strong></p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Supply Item</th>
      <th>Retail Price</th>
      <th>What You Pay</th>
      <th>Markup</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Toilet paper (bulk)</strong></td>
      <td>RM25/case</td>
      <td>RM30-32/case</td>
      <td><strong>20-28%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Liquid soap</strong></td>
      <td>RM40/case</td>
      <td>RM48-52/case</td>
      <td><strong>20-30%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Towels (bulk)</strong></td>
      <td>RM25/towel</td>
      <td>RM30-33/towel</td>
      <td><strong>20-32%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Annual impact (avg RM800/year supplies):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual cost: RM800</li>
  <li>What you paid: RM960-1,040</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden profit: RM160-240/year</strong></li>
  <li><strong>3-year cost: RM480-720</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why they do it:</strong> You buy supplies every month. Small markups add up consistently.</p>

<p><strong>Flat fee advantage:</strong> We buy bulk and pass savings to you. No markup.</p>

<h2>Hidden Cost #4: "Emergency Call" Fees (RM50-100/call)</h2>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Your manager says: "We provide responsive support for your guests."</p>

<p>What they don't say: "After 6 PM or weekends, we charge RM50-100 per call as an 'emergency fee.'"</p>

<p><strong>Real example from client statements:</strong></p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Emergency Calls</th>
      <th>Fee Charged</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>January</strong></td>
      <td>6 calls</td>
      <td>RM480 (RM80 avg)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>February</strong></td>
      <td>4 calls</td>
      <td>RM300 (RM75 avg)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>March</strong></td>
      <td>7 calls</td>
      <td>RM560 (RM80 avg)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Annual impact (avg 6 calls/month):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hidden profit: RM4,800-6,000/year</strong></li>
  <li><strong>3-year cost: RM14,400-18,000</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why they do it:</strong> Guests frequently need help outside business hours. This creates a recurring revenue stream.</p>

<p><strong>Flat fee advantage:</strong> responsive support is included. No emergency fees ever.</p>

<h2>Hidden Cost #5: Platform Fee Padding (1-2%)</h2>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Your manager says: "We handle all platform fees (Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.)."</p>

<p>What they don't say: "We add 1-2% to platform fees as a 'processing fee' for ourselves."</p>

<p><strong>Real example:</strong></p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Platform</th>
      <th>Actual Fee</th>
      <th>What They Charged</th>
      <th>Extra</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Airbnb</strong></td>
      <td>3% of booking</td>
      <td>4% of booking</td>
      <td><strong>+1%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Booking.com</strong></td>
      <td>3% of booking</td>
      <td>4.5% of booking</td>
      <td><strong>+1.5%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Agoda</strong></td>
      <td>3% of booking</td>
      <td>4% of booking</td>
      <td><strong>+1%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Annual impact (RM120,000 gross revenue):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual platform fees: RM3,600</li>
  <li>What you paid: RM4,800-5,400</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden profit: RM1,200-1,800/year</strong></li>
  <li><strong>3-year cost: RM3,600-5,400</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why they do it:</strong> Platform fees are unavoidable. Adding 1% is pure profit.</p>

<p><strong>Flat fee advantage:</strong> Platform fees pass through at cost. No padding.</p>

<h2>Hidden Cost #6: "Premium" Service Upsells</h2>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Your manager says: "Basic service is included, but we offer premium upgrades."</p>

<p>What they don't say: "These 'premium' services have 50-100% margins and we'll push them hard."</p>

<p><strong>Common premium upsells:</strong></p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Premium Service</th>
      <th>Actual Cost</th>
      <th>What They Charge</th>
      <th>Margin</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Professional photography</strong></td>
      <td>RM300-400</td>
      <td>RM600-800</td>
      <td><strong>100%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Floor plan rendering</strong></td>
      <td>RM150</td>
      <td>RM300-400</td>
      <td><strong>100-166%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Listing optimization</strong></td>
      <td>RM0 (done in-house)</td>
      <td>RM200-300</td>
      <td><strong>Infinite%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Guest welcome packs</strong></td>
      <td>RM25/pack</td>
      <td>RM50/pack</td>
      <td><strong>100%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Annual impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hidden profit: RM500-2,000/year</strong> (varies by what you buy)</li>
  <li><strong>3-year cost: RM1,500-6,000</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why they do it:</strong> One-time sales with huge margins boost profits.</p>

<p><strong>Flat fee advantage:</strong> Professional photography and listing optimization are included. No upsells.</p>

<h2>Hidden Cost #7: Cancellation/Change Fees (RM50-150)</h2>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Your manager says: "We handle guest cancellations and booking changes."</p>

<p>What they don't say: "We charge RM50-150 per cancellation/change as an 'administration fee.'"</p>

<p><strong>Real example:</strong></p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Cancellations</th>
      <th>Fee Charged</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Average</strong></td>
      <td>4-6 cancellations</td>
      <td>RM200-900/month</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Annual impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hidden profit: RM2,400-10,800/year</strong></li>
  <li><strong>3-year cost: RM7,200-32,400</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why they do it:</strong> Cancellations are common. Fees monetize a necessary service.</p>

<p><strong>Flat fee advantage:</strong> Cancellations and changes are included. No fees.</p>

<h2>Total Hidden Costs: The Real Numbers</h2>

<p>Add up all the hidden fees and the picture becomes clear:</p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Hidden Cost</th>

      <td><strong>Platform fee padding</strong></td>
      <td>RM1,200-1,800</td>
      <td>RM3,600-5,400</td>
    </tr>
