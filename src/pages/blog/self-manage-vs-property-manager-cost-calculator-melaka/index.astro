<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Should You Self-Manage Your Melaka Airbnb?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>Only if your time is worth less than RM30/hour.</strong> Managing a single unit takes roughly 25 hours per month (messaging, cleaning coordination, maintenance). A management fee of 20% buys you freedom and typically results in 15% higher revenue due to professional pricing strategies.</p>
</div>

<p>It's the classic investor trap: "I'll just manage it myself to save the commission."</p>

<p>Three months later, you are driving from KL to Melaka at 11 PM because the digital lock battery died, and your guest is screaming on the phone. Is that savings?</p>

<p>At iHousing, we believe transparency is key. Here is the mathematical breakdown of what self-management actually costs you in 2026.</p>

<h2>The Hidden Costs of "Free" Management</h2>

<p>Let's assume your unit generates <strong>RM 5,000/month</strong> in revenue.</p>

<p><strong>Compare:</strong> iHousing's fee on RM 5,000 revenue is roughly <strong>RM 1,000</strong> (20%). You are technically <em>losing</em> money by self-managing if you value your time.</p>

<h2>The "Revenue Gap"</h2>

<p>It's not just about costs; it's about income.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> We use algorithms to adjust prices daily. Self-managers usually set a flat rate and miss out on peak demand surges (e.g., concert weekends).</li>
    <li><strong>Response Time:</strong> We reply in <5 minutes. This boosts search ranking. Self-managers reply when they are free (often hours later), losing the booking.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Platform:</strong> We list on Agoda, Booking.com, Expedia. Self-managers usually stick to just Airbnb.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Managed properties typically see <strong>15-20% higher revenue</strong> than self-managed ones. This often covers the management fee entirely.</p>

<h2>The "Midnight Call" Factor</h2>

<p>A pipe bursts at 3 AM. The WiFi goes down during a guest's Zoom meeting. The neighbor complains about noise.</p>
<p>If you self-manage, <strong>you are the on-call staff</strong>. If you hire iHousing, we are.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Self-management makes sense if you are retired, live within 10 minutes of the property, and enjoy hospitality.</p>
<p>If you are an investor looking for passive income, hiring a professional manager is mathematically the smarter choice.</p>
