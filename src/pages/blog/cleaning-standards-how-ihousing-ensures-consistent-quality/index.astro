<h2>Why Clean Properties Make More Money (It's Not Just About Hygiene)</h2>

<p>Here's a truth many hosts don't realize:</p>

<p><strong>Cleanliness directly impacts your revenue.</strong></p>

<p>It's not just about hygiene. It's about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Guest reviews:</strong> Cleanliness rating is the #1 factor guests consider when choosing</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat bookings:</strong> Guests return to properties that feel consistently fresh</li>
  <li><strong>Higher rates:</strong> You can charge 20-30% more for "sparkling clean" vs "acceptable"</li>
  <li><strong>Fewer complaints:</strong> Clean properties have 70% fewer guest issues</li>
</ul>

<p>At iHousing, we don't leave cleanliness to chance. We've built a comprehensive cleaning system that ensures <strong>every guest arrives to a spotless property</strong>.</p>

<p>This article explains our cleaning standards, why they matter, and how we maintain consistency across 100+ properties.</p>

<h2>The iHousing Cleaning Advantage: In-House Team</h2>

<h3>Why We Don't Outsource Cleaning</h3>

<p>Most Airbnb management companies outsource cleaning to freelance cleaners or third-party agencies. We don't.</p>

<p><strong>Our approach:</strong> In-house cleaning team employed directly by iHousing.</p>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>

<h2>Quality Control: How We Ensure Consistency</h2>

<h3>Three-Tier Quality Assurance</h3>

<h4>Tier 1: Cleaner Self-Check</h4>

<p>After cleaning, the cleaner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completes digital checklist via mobile app</li>
  <li>Takes before/after photos (stored in property file)</li>
  <li>Reports any damages or maintenance issues</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tier 2: Supervisor Spot Checks</h4>

<p>Our supervisors conduct random spot checks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 20% of cleans (1 in 5 properties)</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> After cleaner completion, before guest arrival</li>
  <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Properties graded 1-10 (must score 8+ to pass)</li>
  <li><strong>Failure Protocol:</strong> Properties failing 8+ score get immediate re-clean</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tier 3: Guest Feedback Loop</h4>

<p>We monitor guest reviews for cleanliness mentions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cleanliness Rating 5:</strong> Positive feedback to cleaner (performance bonus eligible)</li>
  <li><strong>Cleanliness Rating 4:</strong> Review by supervisor (additional training if needed)</li>
  <li><strong>Cleanliness Rating 3 or below:</strong> Immediate investigation, re-training plan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Linen & Towel Management</h2>

  <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Can process 200 sets of linens per day</li>
  <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> We inspect linens after washing (stains = retirement)</li>
  <li><strong>Replacement Schedule:</strong> Linens retired after 12 months or 50 washes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real Results: Cleanliness Impact on Revenue</h2>

<h3>Case Study: Identical Properties, Different Cleaning Standards</h3>

<p>We tested this with 2 identical condos in same building:</p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Property A (Basic Clean)</th>
      <th>Property B (iHousing Standard)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Cleanliness Rating</strong></td>
      <td>4.2 / 5.0</td>
      <td>4.9 / 5.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Nightly Rate</strong></td>
      <td>RM 180</td>
      <td>RM 220 (+22%)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Occupancy Rate</strong></td>
      <td>62%</td>
      <td>78% (+26%)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Monthly Revenue</strong></td>
      <td>RM 3,356</td>
      <td>RM 5,313 (+58%)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Guest Complaints</strong></td>
      <td>12 complaints/year</td>
      <td>1 complaint/year</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Property B earns 58% more revenue purely due to higher cleanliness standards (same location, same furnishing).</p>

<h2>Owner Dashboard: Cleaning Transparency</h2>
