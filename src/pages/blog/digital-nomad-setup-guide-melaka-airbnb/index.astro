<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>They need more than just WiFi. They need: 1. A dedicated workspace (desk + ergonomic chair), 2. TIME Fibre Internet (100Mbps+ stable connection), 3. Good lighting for Zoom calls, and 4. A coffee machine.</strong> In 2026, Melaka is becoming a cheaper, quieter alternative to Penang/KL for digital nomads. Capture this market to fill your mid-week calendar.</p>

<p>Most Airbnb hosts focus on tourists (weekend traffic). But what happens on Tuesday? Your unit sits empty.
<br><strong>The Solution:</strong> Target digital nomads who stay Monday-Friday.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we have seen a 30% increase in "work-from-home" bookings since 2024. Here is how to set up your unit to attract them.</p>

<h2>The Essential "Work-Ready" Setup</h2>

<p>Don't just put a laptop on the dining table. That's uncomfortable for an 8-hour workday.</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>The Chair:</strong> Invest in a decent mesh office chair (RM 300+). No plastic stools. Your guest's back will thank you in the review.</li>
    <li><strong>The Desk:</strong> Minimum 120cm width. Enough space for a laptop, mouse, and coffee. Ideally placed near a window for natural light but away from glare.</li>
    <li><strong>The Monitor:</strong> Buy a used 24-inch monitor (RM 250) and leave an HDMI cable. This is a huge "wow" factor for programmers and designers.</li>
    <li><strong>The Internet:</strong> <strong>TIME Fibre</strong> is non-negotiable. Mobile hotspots or slow TM Streamyx will get you 1-star reviews. Post a speed test screenshot in your listing photos.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The "Coffee & Power" Rule</h2>

<p>Nomads run on caffeine and electricity.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Power Strips:</strong> Place one <em>on</em> the desk. Don't make them crawl under it.</li>
    <li><strong>Coffee Machine:</strong> A Nespresso or Dolce Gusto machine (RM 300) adds a premium touch. Leave a few starter pods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost vs. Revenue Analysis</h2>

<p>Is it worth upgrading?</p>

<h2>Marketing Your "Workstation"</h2>

<p>Take a specific photo of the workspace.
<br><strong>Caption it:</strong> "Dedicated Workspace with 100Mbps WiFi + Monitor."
<br><strong>In Description:</strong> "Perfect for remote work. Quiet neighborhood. Grocery store downstairs."</p>

<h2>Why Melaka for Nomads?</h2>

<p>It's walkable, food is cheap, and the internet is fast. Compare rent in <strong>Atlantis</strong> vs. a condo in KLCC. Melaka wins on value.</p>
