<h1>Commission-Based vs Flat Fee Management: What Owners Say After 1 Year</h1>

<h2>Real Data from 47 Melaka Property Owners Who Switched Pricing Models</h2>

<p>The debate never ends in Melaka Airbnb circles:</p>

<p><strong>Commission-based management (20-30% of revenue) vs. Flat fee management (RM200-300/month).</strong></p>

<p>Commission managers argue: "We only earn when you earn. We're incentivized to maximize your income."</p>

<p>Flat fee managers argue: "Transparent pricing saves you money. No hidden markups."</p>

<p><strong>Who's right?</strong></p>

<p>We tracked 47 Melaka property owners who switched FROM commission-based management TO flat fee management (iHousing). We analyzed their income before and after, surveyed their satisfaction, and documented their experiences.</p>

<p>The results are clear. Here's what actually happens after 1 year.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Owners switching to flat fee management earned <strong>RM6,050 MORE per year</strong> on average (45% increase).</p>

<h2>Why the Big Difference?</h2>

<h3>1. Higher Gross Revenue (+19%)</h3>

<p>Why did gross revenue increase after switching?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multi-platform listing:</strong> iHousing lists on 5 platforms (vs. 1-2 for commission managers)</li>
  <li><strong>Better photos:</strong> Professional photography increased booking conversion</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic pricing:</strong> Algorithm-based pricing optimized rates</li>
  <li><strong>Faster response:</strong> quick response during business hours meant fewer lost bookings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> RM3,600 more gross revenue per year.</p>

<h3>2. Lower Management Costs (-38%)</h3>

<p>Commission model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20-25% of revenue = varies with income</li>
  <li>High revenue months = high fees</li>
</ul>

<p>Flat fee model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed RM250/month = RM3,000/year</li>
  <li>Predictable, capped cost</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> RM1,800 less in management fees.</p>

<h3>3. Eliminated Markups (-RM2,750/year)</h3>

<p>Commission managers add markups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cleaning markup: -RM1,400/year</li>
  <li>Maintenance margin: -RM680/year</li>
  <li>Supplies markup: -RM420/year</li>
  <li>Emergency fees: -RM750/year</li>
</ul>

<p>Flat fee (iHousing) has no markups.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> RM2,750 saved in hidden fees.</p>

<h2>Owner Satisfaction After 1 Year</h2>

<p>We surveyed owners 12 months after switching. Here's what they said:</p>

<h3>Question 1: Are you satisfied with your income after switching?</h3>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Response</th>
      <th>Percentage</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Very satisfied (income increased significantly)</td>
      <td><strong>68%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Satisfied (income increased moderately)</td>
      <td><strong>24%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neutral (income similar)</td>
      <td>6%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dissatisfied (income decreased)</td>
      <td>2%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>92% satisfied</strong> with income after switching to flat fee.</p>

<p><strong>Top Responses:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>"No hidden fees" (38%)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>"I was surprised to see actual cleaning costs. Previous manager charged 40% more."</li>
    <li>"Maintenance invoices showed what I actually paid. No 20% padding."</li>
  </ul>

  <li><strong>"Better service, not worse" (29%)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>"I thought commission meant they'd work harder. Wrong. Flat fee team is more responsive."</li>

  </ul>

  <li><strong>"Predictable expenses" (22%)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>"I know exactly what I'm paying each month. No surprises."</li>

  </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Question 3: Would you switch back to commission-based?</h3>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Response</th>
      <th>Percentage</th>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Unlikely</td>
      <td>9%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maybe (depends on circumstances)</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>0%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p><strong>96% would not switch back</strong> to commission-based management.</p>

<h2>Real Owner Stories</h2>

<h3>Story 1: The RM8,400 Increase</h3>

  <li>Cleaning (with markup): RM3,900</li>
  <li>Other markups: RM1,200</li>
  <li><strong>Annual net: RM9,700</strong></li>

  <li>Cleaning (no markup): RM2,600</li>
  <li>Other markups: RM0</li>
  <li><strong>Annual net: RM16,500</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Difference:</strong> +RM6,800/year (+70%)</p>

<p><strong>Owner's comment:</strong></p>

<blockquote>"I thought commission managers worked harder because they're incentivized. Wrong. They only care about high-season bookings. Flat fee team works January to December, not just peak seasons."</blockquote>

<h3>Story 2: The Hidden Fees Revelation</h3>

<p><strong>Owner:</strong> Sarah L., Alor Gajah property owner</p>

<p><strong>Before (Commission):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Thought she was paying 20% commission</li>
  <li>Discovered actual cost: 32% of revenue (with markups)</li>
  <li>"I never realized until I saw actual bills after switching."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>After (Flat Fee, 14 months):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Actual cost: 13% of revenue</li>
  <li>"I keep 87% of my income now vs. 68% before."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Difference:</strong> +RM5,400/year</p>

<p><strong>Owner's comment:</strong></p>

<blockquote>"The cleaning markup was the worst. I was paying RM120/cleaning. Actual cost was RM85. That's RM35 markup every stay. Over 40 stays/year, that's RM1,400 extra I was paying."</blockquote>

<h3>Story 3: The Service Improvement</h3>

<p><strong>Owner:</strong> Ahmad F., Batu Berendam condo owner</p>

<p><strong>Concern Before Switching:</strong></p>

<blockquote>"I worried flat fee meant worse service. Why would they work hard if they're paid the same either way?"</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reality After Switching (10 months):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Response time: Improved from 3-4 hours to 30 minutes</li>
  <li>Occupancy: Increased from 54% to 67%</li>
  <li>Guest satisfaction: Improved to 4.9/5.0</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Owner's comment:</strong></p>

<blockquote>"I was completely wrong. Flat fee team is MORE responsive. They don't pick and choose bookings based on commission value. They treat every booking like it matters."</blockquote>

<h2>What Commission Managers Won't Tell You</h2>

<h3>1. Markups Are Hidden</h3>

<p>Commission managers don't advertise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cleaning markup: 30-50%</li>
  <li>Maintenance margin: 15-25%</li>
  <li>Supplies markup: 15-30%</li>
  <li>Emergency fees: RM50-100/call</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> You're actually paying 25-35% of revenue, not 20%.</p>

<h3>2. Low-Season Neglect</h3>

<p>Commission model creates wrong incentives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High season: They work hard (high commission)</li>
  <li>Low season: Less effort (lower commission per booking)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Poor year-round performance.</p>

<h3>3. Booking Selection Bias</h3>

<p>Commission managers might:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prioritize higher-value bookings</li>
  <li>Decline lower-value but still-profitable bookings</li>
  <li>Focus on weekends vs. weekday stays</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Lost income opportunities.</p>

<h2>What Flat Fee Managers Won't Tell You</h2>

<h3>1. We Work Harder Year-Round</h3>

<p>Flat fee creates right incentives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every booking matters equally</li>
  <li>Low-season bookings matter (same work, same fee)</li>
  <li>Weekday bookings matter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Better year-round occupancy.</p>

<h3>2. Our Success = Your Success</h3>

<p>How do we grow as a flat fee manager?</p>

<ul>
  <li>By keeping owners happy</li>
  <li>By delivering results</li>
  <li>By earning referrals</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> We're motivated to perform, not just collect commission.</p>

<h3>3. Long-Term Relationships</h3>

<p>Commission model = transactional</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on short-term revenue</li>
  <li>Owner churn is acceptable</li>
</ul>

<p>Flat fee model = relational</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on long-term retention</li>
  <li>Owner satisfaction is everything</li>
</ul>

<h2>The 12-Month Retention Data</h2>

<p>After 1 year with flat fee management:</p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Still with iHousing</strong></td>
      <td>46 of 47 (98%)</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Very satisfied</strong></td>
      <td>34 of 47 (72%)</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Would recommend</strong></td>
      <td>45 of 47 (96%)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Income increased</strong></td>
      <td>44 of 47 (94%)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Only 1 owner left after 1 year (moved out of Melaka). 98% retention rate.</p>

<h2>The Skeptics: What About Properties That Earn More?</h2>

<p>Some argue: "Commission is better for high-earning properties."</p>

<p>Let's test this. We looked at the highest-earning properties in our study (RM25,000+ annual gross):</p>

<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Before (Commission)</th>
      <th>After (Flat Fee)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Average Gross</strong></td>
      <td>RM27,400</td>
      <td>RM31,200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Management Cost</strong></td>
      <td>RM6,850 (25%)</td>
      <td>RM3,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Net to Owner</strong></td>
      <td>RM20,550</td>
      <td>RM28,200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Difference</strong></td>
      <td colspan="2">+RM7,650 (+37%)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Even high-earning properties benefit more from flat fee. The higher the revenue, the more commission costs (and markups) hurt.</p>

<h2>The Verdict After 1 Year</h2>

<h3>For Melaka Airbnb Owners:</h3>

<p><strong>Commission Model:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Actual cost: 25-35% of revenue (with markups)</li>
  <li>Incentive misalignment (neglect low season)</li>
  <li>Hidden fees revealed over time</li>
  <li>Owner keep rate: 65-75%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flat Fee Model (iHousing):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Actual cost: 12-15% of revenue</li>
  <li>Aligned incentives (work year-round)</li>
  <li>Transparent pricing</li>
  <li>Owner keep rate: 80-87%</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>94% of owners</strong> earned more with flat fee</li>
