<h1>Coastal Property Turnaround: From 40% to 75% Occupancy in 3 Months</h1>

<h2>The Problem: Empty Beach House Bleeding RM3,000 Monthly</h2>

<p>When Mr. Lim first contacted iHousing in August 2025, his Pantai Kundur beachfront condo was sitting empty 60% of the time. He was earning RM4,800/month during peak weekends but barely covering his maintenance fees the rest of the month.</p>

<p>"I listed it on Airbnb myself," he told us. "But bookings were sporadic. I'd get 3-4 nights one week, then nothing for 10 days. The unpredictability was killing me."</p>

<p>He'd tried commission-based management (20% fee) but quit after 6 months. "I was paying RM800-1,000/month in commissions and still had empty weekdays. It didn't make sense."</p>

<p>Here's exactly how iHousing turned his property around—and how you can apply the same strategies.</p>

<h2>Month 1: Foundation Changes</h2>

<h3>Week 1: Professional Photography</h3>

<p>We hired a professional real estate photographer (RM400 investment). Before/After comparison:</p>

<p><strong>Before:</strong> Dark smartphone photos, clutter visible, no people in shots</p>

<p><strong>After:</strong> Bright lifestyle photos showing guests enjoying the space, staged with decorative elements, sunset views highlighted</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Click-through rate increased 47% in first 2 weeks.</p>

<h3>Week 2: Multi-Platform Listing</h3>

<p>We expanded from 1 platform to 5:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> Updated existing listing with new photos</li>
<li><strong>Booking.com:</strong> Created new listing targeting business travelers</li>
<li><strong>Agoda:</strong> Created new listing targeting Singaporean weekenders</li>
<li><strong>VRBO:</strong> Created new listing targeting families</li>
<li><strong>Expedia:</strong> Created new listing for international tourists</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Inquiries increased from 8/week to 23/week.</p>

<h3>Week 3: Content Overhaul</h3>

<p>We rewrote the listing description to emphasize activities, not just features. Added sections on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fishing spots within walking distance</li>
<li>Sunset photography locations</li>
<li>Recommended seafood restaurants (with prices)</li>
<li>Weekend warrior targeting (KL/Singapore guests)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Booking conversion rate increased from 22% to 34%.</p>

<h3>Week 4: Pricing Restructure</h3>

<p>Implemented dynamic pricing based on day-of-week:</p>

<td>Premium pricing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monday-Thursday</td>
<td>350</td>
<td>220</td>
<td>Volume pricing</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Weekday occupancy increased from 25% to 52% while weekend revenue grew 12%.</p>

<h2>Month 2: Optimization Phase</h2>

<h3>Guest Communication System</h3>

<p>Implemented automated yet personalized communication:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Instant response:</strong> Auto-reply within 5 minutes (Available during business hours)</li>
<li><strong>Information pack:</strong> PDF with activities, restaurants, tide charts sent at booking</li>
<li><strong>Check-in coordination:</strong> Personal welcome with orientation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Guest satisfaction score increased from 4.3 to 4.7.</p>

<h3>Activity-Based Marketing</h3>

<p>We created 3 listing variations targeting different guest types:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fishing enthusiasts:</strong> Emphasized casting from balcony, fish cleaning station</li>
<li><strong>Families:</strong> Highlighted shallow swimming, kid-friendly restaurants</li>
<li><strong>Couples:</strong> Featured sunset deck, romantic dining spots</li>
</ol>

<p>Each variation directed guests to appropriate booking platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Weekday bookings from targeted segments increased 65%.</p>

<h2>Month 3: Scaling Success</h2>

<h3>Review Generation System</h3>

<li><strong>Incentive:</strong> Future booking discount for detailed reviews</li>
<li><strong>Response strategy:</strong> Responded to every review within 24 hours</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> 8 new reviews (all 5-star), bringing average to 4.8.</p>

<h3>Corporate Booking Outreach</h3>

<ul>
<li>Melaka factories (SG/MY staff retreat venues)</li>
<li>Singapore companies (weekend team building)</li>
<li>Hospital visitor services (long-term patient families)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Secured 3 corporate contracts for weekday stays.</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Annual impact:</strong> Additional RM75,600/year for RM3,600/year in management fees.</p>

<h2>What Worked (Key Success Factors)</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Multi-platform presence:</strong> 5 platforms captured demand wherever guests searched</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic pricing:</strong> Lower weekday rates filled gaps without sacrificing weekend revenue</li>
<li><strong>Professional photos:</strong> 47% increase in clicks justified the RM400 investment immediately</li>
<li><strong>Activity-focused content:</strong> Guests could imagine themselves enjoying the space</li>
<li><strong>Targeted marketing:</strong> Different messages for fishing enthusiasts, families, couples</li>
<li><strong>Communication excellence:</strong> responsive responsiveness built guest confidence</li>
</ol>

<h2>What Didn't Work (Lessons Learned)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Initial weekday pricing (RM350):</strong> Still too high. Reduced to RM220 to hit 50%+ occupancy.</li>
<li><strong>Generic activity descriptions:</strong> Vague "beach activities" didn't convert. Specific details (fishing spots, restaurant names, prices) worked better.</li>
<li><strong>Expecting corporate bookings immediately:</strong> Took 6 weeks of outreach to secure first corporate contract.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The iHousing Difference</h2>

<p>Why did Mr. Lim's property succeed with iHousing when it failed with commission-based management?</p>

<p><strong>Commission model problem:</strong> Manager earns 20% regardless of occupancy. Low weekday rates reduce their commission, so they discourage strategies that maximize volume.</p>

<p><strong>iHousing flat-fee advantage:</strong> We earn RM300/month whether the property makes RM5,000 or RM15,000. Our incentive is maximizing total occupancy and revenue, not protecting per-night commission.</p>

<h2>Can This Work for Your Coastal Property?</h2>

<p>Mr. Lim's property isn't unique. We've replicated similar results across 20+ beach properties in Melaka. The principles are the same:</p>

<ul>
<li>Professional photos that show lifestyle, not just features</li>
<li>Multi-platform listing to capture all demand</li>
<li>Dynamic pricing that fills weekday gaps</li>
<li>Activity-based content that helps guests imagine experiences</li>
<li>responsive communication that builds confidence</li>
<li>Targeted marketing for specific guest segments</li>
</ul>

<p>The exact tactics vary by location (Pantai Kundur vs. Tanjung Bidara vs. other beaches), but the strategy is consistent.</p>

<h2>Ready to Turn Around Your Coastal Property?</h2>

<p>iHousing's flat RM200-300/month fee means we only succeed when you do. We don't profit from commission—we profit from performance.</p>

<p>Our team will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take professional photos (or review your existing ones)</li>
