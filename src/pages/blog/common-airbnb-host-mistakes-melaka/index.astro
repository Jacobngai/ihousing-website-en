<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>The deadly trio: 1. Underpricing (leaving money on the table), 2. Ignoring Preventative Maintenance (wait until AC breaks), and 3. Bad Photos (dark, amateur shots).</strong> In 2026, guests have hundreds of options. One mistake means they scroll past your listing.</p>
</div>

<p>Hosting looks easy. Take photos, list on Airbnb, profit. Right? Wrong.
<br>We have taken over dozens of "failing" units where owners were losing money despite having a great property. Here is why.</p>

<h2>Mistake 1: The "Set It and Forget It" Pricing</h2>

<p>You set your price at RM 200 in January and never change it.
<br><strong>The Problem:</strong> In May (school holidays), you could have charged RM 350. You lost RM 150/night. In October (low season), your RM 200 is too high, so you get zero bookings.
<br><strong>The Fix:</strong> Dynamic pricing. Adjust rates daily based on demand.</p>

<h2>Mistake 2: Reactive Maintenance</h2>

<p>Waiting for the air-conditioner to leak before servicing it.
<br><strong>The Cost:</strong>
<br>Option A: Service AC = RM 80.
<br>Option B: Guest complains at midnight -> Refund night (RM 200) + Emergency Repair (RM 150) + Bad Review (Priceless damage).
<br><strong>The Fix:</strong> Schedule quarterly servicing for AC, plumbing, and pest control.</p>

<h2>Mistake 3: Cheap Furniture</h2>

<p>Buying the cheapest sofa from Shopee.
<br><strong>The Reality:</strong> It breaks in 3 months. You buy another one.
<br><strong>The Fix:</strong> Buy commercial-grade or solid wood furniture. It costs 2x more but lasts 10x longer.</p>

<h2>Mistake 4: Ghosting Guests</h2>

<p>Taking 4 hours to reply to "Is there parking?"
<br><strong>The Result:</strong> The guest booked another unit 3 hours ago.
<br><strong>The Fix:</strong> Automated replies for common questions. Aim for <5 min response time.</p>

<h2>Mistake 5: Single Platform Dependence</h2>

<p>Listing only on Airbnb.
<br><strong>The Risk:</strong> Airbnb suspends your account for a random verification check. Your income hits zero.
<br><strong>The Fix:</strong> List on Agoda, Booking.com, and Expedia immediately.</p>

<h2>The Cost of Incompetence</h2>
