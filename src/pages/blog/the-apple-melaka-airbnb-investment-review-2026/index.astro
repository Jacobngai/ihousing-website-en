		<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>The Verdict:</strong> The Apple Melaka is the top choice for <strong>premium travelers and couples</strong> who value location over "kid amenities." While Atlantis wins on family volume, The Apple commands higher nightly rates (RM280+) and attracts better-behaved guests. In 2026, it's yielding a solid <strong>7-9% ROI</strong> for our owners.</p>
	</div>

	<p>If you've driven through Melaka recently, you can't miss <strong>The Apple</strong>. Sitting tall next to the Courtyard by Marriott on Jalan Tun Sri Lanang, it looks more like a luxury hotel than a typical condo. And that's exactly why it's interesting for Airbnb investors.</p>

	<p>At iHousing, we manage units across all major Melaka residences—Atlantis, Silverscape, The Wave, and The Apple. We see the real booking data every day. Here is our honest, numbers-backed review of The Apple as an investment property in 2026.</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Location: The Real Selling Point</h2>
	<p>This is where The Apple shines. Unlike Atlantis (which requires a Grab to get anywhere) or Silverscape (which is further south), The Apple is genuinely central.</p>
	
	<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
		<li><strong>The Shore Shopping Gallery:</strong> 5-minute walk.</li>
		<li><strong>Melaka River Cruise:</strong> 5-minute walk.</li>
		<li><strong>Jonker Street:</strong> 10-15 minute walk (or a cheap RM5 Grab).</li>
		<li><strong>Bunga Raya Food Street:</strong> Right nearby for authentic local food.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Why this matters for Airbnb:</strong> Guests staying here often don't need a car. This makes it a magnet for Singaporean couples who take the bus up, or international tourists who want to explore on foot.</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Pros: Why Investors Love It</h2>
	
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">1. The "Hotel" Feel</h3>
	<p>Sharing the building block with a Marriott hotel rubs off on the residence. The lobby is grander, the security feels tighter, and the infinity pool is genuinely stunning without being overrun by screaming toddlers (unlike the water parks at other condos). This allows you to charge a premium price.</p>

	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">2. Higher Quality Guests</h3>
	<p>Because of the price point and the lack of a "kid's water park," The Apple attracts fewer large noisy families and more couples or business travelers. For an owner, this means <strong>less maintenance</strong>. Your furniture lasts longer, and you get fewer noise complaints.</p>

	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">3. Strata Title & Airbnb Friendliness</h3>
	<p>As of 2026, The Apple remains Airbnb-friendly, provided you follow the management rules. The management is professional (hotel-standard), which keeps the common areas pristine—a huge factor in getting 5-star reviews.</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Cons: What to Watch Out For</h2>
	<p>No investment is perfect. Here are the challenges:</p>
	<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
		<li><strong>Parking:</strong> Like many central Melaka buildings, the parking ramp can be tight and dizzying. Guests with large MPVs sometimes complain.</li>
		<li><strong>Lift Wait Times:</strong> During peak public holidays, lifts can be slow, though generally better than the massive blocks at Atlantis.</li>
		<li><strong>Price:</strong> The entry cost to buy a unit here is higher per sqft than in Kota Laksamana. You need to run your numbers carefully.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">ROI Analysis: Can You Make Money?</h2>
	<p>Let's look at a typical <strong>2-Bedroom Unit</strong> performance in 2026 managed by iHousing:</p>

	<div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
		<ul class="space-y-2">
			<li><strong>Avg. Monthly Revenue:</strong> RM 5,500 - RM 7,000 (depending on season)</li>
			<li><strong>Cleaning & Utilities:</strong> - RM 1,200</li>
			<li><strong>Management Fee (Flat Fee):</strong> - RM 350</li>
			<li><strong>Net Operating Income:</strong> ~RM 4,000 - RM 5,450</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-600"><em>*Note: Excludes mortgage and sinking fund. Based on iHousing managed units.</em></p>
	</div>

	<p>If your mortgage is under RM 3,500, you are likely cash-flow positive. If you bought cash or have a low loan, the returns beat almost any fixed deposit.</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion: Should You Buy?</h2>
	<p><strong>Buy The Apple IF:</strong> You want a prestigious property, prefer dealing with fewer (but higher-paying) guests, and value long-term asset appreciation in a prime location.</p>
	<p><strong>Look elsewhere IF:</strong> You want maximum occupancy volume at all costs (go Atlantis) or want a low-cost entry point (look at older apartments).</p>
