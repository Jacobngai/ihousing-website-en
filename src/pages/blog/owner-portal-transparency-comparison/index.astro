<h1>Owner Portal Comparison: Transparency That Builds Trust</h1>

<h2>Why Owner Portal Transparency Matters</h2>

<p>Property owners deserve <strong>complete visibility</strong> into how their Airbnb investment performs. Yet many property managers operate as black boxes - taking percentage commissions without showing detailed breakdowns.</p>

<p>With iHousing's owner portal, you get 100% transparency responsive. See exactly what you earn, what we spend, and where every ringgit goes.</p>

<p>What other managers don't show you:</p>

  <li><strong>Actual nightly rates:</strong> They discount heavily but don't disclose</li>
  <li><strong>Platform fees:</strong> Bundled into net amount</li>
  <li><strong>Cleaning costs:</strong> Marked up but shown as flat fee</li>
  <li><strong>Maintenance expenses:</strong> Inflated but hidden</li>
  <li><strong>Booking details:</strong> Summary only, no guest info</li>
  <li><strong>Calendar availability:</strong> Can't see real-time status</li>
</ul>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Long-term partnerships:</strong> Trust retains clients for years</li>
  <li><strong>Shared success:</strong> We succeed when you succeed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Owner Testimonial</h2>

<p><em>"I switched from a 20% commission manager to iHousing. The old company never showed me actual expenses or booking details. Now I can see everything in real-time. I discovered they were charging me RM150 for cleaning that cost RM80. With iHousing, I pay RM80 - exactly what the cleaning team charges. The portal transparency is invaluable."</em></p>

<p>- Sarah T., Parkland Avenue Owner</p>
