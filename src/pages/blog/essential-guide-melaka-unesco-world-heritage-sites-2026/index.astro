<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>The core four remain: 1. A Famosa Fortress (Porta de Santiago), 2. St. Paul's Hill & Church, 3. The Stadthuys & Christ Church (Red Square), and 4. Cheng Hoon Teng Temple (Oldest Chinese Temple).</strong> In 2026, preservation efforts have made these sites even more accessible, with better pedestrian walkways connecting <strong>Jonker Walk</strong> to the <strong>Melaka River</strong>.</p>

<p>Melaka isn't just a city; it is a living museum. Since gaining UNESCO status in 2008, it has become a global icon. For Airbnb hosts, proximity to these sites is the #1 driver of nightly rates. Guests want to be where the history is.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we manage properties both inside the Heritage Zone (shophouses) and just outside (modern condos). Here is your guide to helping guests explore.</p>

<h2>The Red Square (Dutch Square)</h2>

<p>The iconic red buildings are the heart of Melaka.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>The Stadthuys:</strong> Built in 1650 as the office of the Dutch Governor. Now a history museum.</li>
    <li><strong>Christ Church:</strong> Built in 1753 with pink bricks brought from Zeeland, Netherlands.</li>
    <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Visit before 9:00 AM to get a photo without 50 tour buses in the background.</li>
</ul>

<h2>St. Paul's Hill & A Famosa</h2>

<p>A short climb up from the Red Square leads to the ruins of St. Paul's Church, where St. Francis Xavier was once buried. Walk down the other side to see <strong>A Famosa</strong>, the last gate of the Portuguese fortress.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Best Time:</strong> Sunset (6:30 PM - 7:15 PM). The view of the Straits of Melaka is unbeatable, and the heat is bearable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Street of Harmony (Jalan Tukang Emas)</h2>

<p>This single street showcases Melaka's multicultural soul.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Cheng Hoon Teng Temple:</strong> The oldest functioning Chinese temple in Malaysia (1645).</li>
    <li><strong>Kampung Kling Mosque:</strong> A unique mosque with Sumatran architecture and a pagoda-like minaret.</li>
    <li><strong>Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple:</strong> The oldest Hindu temple in Malaysia.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to Stay: Distance to Heritage Zone</h2>

<p>Guests often underestimate the heat. Staying within walking distance is a huge plus.</p>

<h2>Why Heritage Listings Command a Premium</h2>

<p>Properties located within the buffer zone, like restored shophouses on <strong>Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock</strong>, can charge 30-50% more per night. Guests pay for the atmosphere.</p>

<p>However, maintenance is higher (old pipes, roof leaks). iHousing specializes in managing these unique heritage assets, balancing preservation with modern guest comfort.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Melaka's history is its biggest asset. Whether you own a modern condo with a view of the city or a pre-war shophouse, understanding the UNESCO zone helps you market your property effectively.</p>
