<h1>Agoda vs Airbnb: Melaka Market Performance Comparison</h1>

<h2>Why Do Some Properties Perform Better on Agoda Than Airbnb?</h2>

<p>Most Melaka Airbnb hosts focus exclusively on Airbnb. But they're missing a massive opportunity: Agoda dominates Asian travel bookings, particularly from Singapore, Indonesia, and China. At iHousing, we've tracked performance across both platforms for 18 months. The data reveals surprising differences that can make or break your revenue strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Surprise:</strong> Airbnb outperforms Agoda on most metrics—but Agoda fills gaps Airbnb misses.</p>

<h2>Property Type Performance: Where Agoda Shines</h2>

<p>Agoda performs exceptionally well for specific property types:</p>

<h3>1. Budget Condos (RM150-250/night)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Agoda occupancy:</strong>78%</li>
<li><strong>Airbnb occupancy:</strong>54%</li>
</ul>

<p>Agoda's search filters make budget properties highly visible. Airbnb guests prioritize aesthetics over price.</p>

<h3>2. Pool/Facility-Rich Properties</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Agoda bookings:</strong>45% come from facility searches (pool, gym, parking)</li>
<li><strong>Airbnb bookings:</strong>22% come from facility searches</li>
</ul>

<p>Agoda's hotel-style interface appeals to guests seeking resort-style amenities.</p>

<h3>3. Last-Minute Bookings</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Agoda:</strong> 41% of bookings are within 3 days of check-in</li>
<li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> 19% of bookings are within 3 days of check-in</li>
</ul>

<p>Agoda captures spontaneous travelers. Airbnb guests plan trips further in advance.</p>

<h2>Guest Demographics: Who's on Each Platform?</h2>

<h3>Singaporean Guests (Critical Segment for Melaka)</h3>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Characteristic</th>
<th>Singaporeans on Airbnb</th>
<th>Singaporeans on Agoda</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Average stay</td>
<td>3.8 nights</td>
<td>2.2 nights</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Average rate paid (RM)</td>
<td>420</td>
<td>360</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bookings/month</td>
<td>4.2</td>
<td>7.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cars/buses</td>
<td>68% drive own cars</td>
<td>52% drive own cars</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Property preference</td>
<td>Heritage, unique</td>
<td>Condo, facilities</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Insight:</strong> Singaporeans book more frequently on Agoda but pay less. They use Airbnb for special occasion stays.</p>

<h2>Commission Structure Comparison</h2>

<p>What each platform charges affects your net revenue:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Fee Type</th>
<th>Airbnb</th>
<th>Agoda</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Host commission</td>
<td>3% (standard)</td>
<td>0-4% (varies by property)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Guest service fee</td>
<td>14% (guest pays)</td>
<td>0-7% (often waived)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Payment processing</td>
<td>3%</td>
<td>2.5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total from host</td>
<td>3-6%</td>
<td>2.5-6.5%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Both platforms take similar cuts. The difference is in guest perception—Airbnb guests see the total price upfront, Agoda guests often see lower display prices.</p>

<h2>Review System Impact</h2>

<p>Reviews drive bookings—but platforms weight them differently:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> Reviews affect search ranking significantly. Guests read 5-7 reviews before booking.</li>
<li><strong>Agoda:</strong> Reviews matter less for ranking. Guests scan scores quickly without reading details.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Airbnb requires proactive review management. Agoda reviews can be managed reactively.</p>

<h2>Seasonal Performance Differences</h2>

<p>Platform strength fluctuates by season:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Season</th>
<th>Airbnb Market Share</th>
<th>Agoda Market Share</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>School holidays (Mar, Jun, Dec)</td>
<td>65%</td>
<td>35%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Peak weekends (Fri-Sun)</td>
<td>62%</td>
<td>38%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School term (low season)</td>
<td>48%</td>
<td>52%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Midweek (Mon-Thu)</td>
<td>44%</td>
<td>56%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Agoda gains market share during off-peak periods when price-sensitive travelers dominate.</p>

<h2>The iHousing Multi-Platform Strategy</h2>

<p>We list properties on both platforms because:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Complementary demand:</strong> Airbnb peak periods differ from Agoda peaks. Both = fuller calendar.</li>
<li><strong>Demographic diversity:</strong> Malaysian guests prefer Airbnb. International Asians prefer Agoda.</li>
<li><strong>Rate optimization:</strong> We set different rates on each platform to capture different segments.</li>
<li><strong>Risk mitigation:</strong> Algorithm changes on one platform don't devastate revenue.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our clients see 60% more bookings than single-platform hosts because we capture demand wherever it originates.</p>

<h2>Which Platform Should You Prioritize?</h2>

<p>For new Melaka hosts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heritage properties:</strong> Airbnb first (heritage seekers use Airbnb)</li>
<li><strong>Standard condos:</strong> Agoda first (functional travelers use Agoda)</li>
<li><strong>Properties with pools:</strong> Agoda first (facility searches dominate Agoda)</li>
<li><strong>Budget properties:</strong> Agoda first (price-sensitive guests use Agoda)</li>
<li><strong>High-end/luxury:</strong> Airbnb first (experience seekers use Airbnb)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real answer:</strong> List on both from day one. iHousing handles setup, optimization, and calendar sync.</p>
