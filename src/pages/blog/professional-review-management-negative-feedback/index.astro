<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Q: Should I respond to every negative review?</h3>

<h3>Q: Can I get a negative review removed?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Only if it violates Airbnb's review policy (extortion, hate speech, false statements). We can help with removal requests.</p>
<h3>Q: How long does a bad review affect bookings?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Impact decreases over time. New positive reviews push down negative ones. With active management, impact is 2-4 months.</p>
