<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Is Avenue-by-the-Sea a Good Airbnb Investment in 2026?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>Yes, it is a top-tier choice for coastal property investors.</strong> Located near the famous Klebang Coconut Shake and beach, it attracts families avoiding the city center jams. With its resort-style facilities and iHousing's exclusive <strong>Flat Rate Management Fee (RM200-300/month)</strong>, the ROI potential is higher than many city center condos.</p>
</div>

<p>While <strong>Atlantis Residences</strong> and <strong>Silverscape</strong> fight for dominance in the city center, a quieter revolution is happening in <strong>Klebang</strong>. Avenue-by-the-Sea (and its neighbors like Riviera Suites) is capturing the family market that wants beach vibes without the hassle of Jonker Street traffic.</p>

<p>iHousing manages multiple units here. This is our honest, data-driven review for 2026.</p>

<h2>Location: The "Coconut Shake" Factor</h2>

<p>Location is everything. Avenue-by-the-Sea is situated perfectly for a relaxing weekend.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Walkability:</strong> It's practically next door to the legendary <strong>Klebang Coconut Shake</strong>. This sounds trivial, but for domestic tourists, it's a huge draw.</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic:</strong> It bypasses the notorious jams of Mahkota Parade. Guests can drive straight from the highway to Klebang.</li>
    <li><strong>Attractions:</strong> 5 minutes to the Submarine Museum and the Dataran 1 Malaysia beach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Flat Rate Advantage (Exclusive to Avenue-by-the-Sea)</h2>

<p>Here is the game-changer. Most management companies in Melaka charge 20-25% of your revenue. iHousing offers a unique model for this development.</p>

<h2>The Amenities</h2>
<p>Families love the pool here. It's resort-style, safe for kids, and large enough that it doesn't feel crowded even on weekends. The gym is functional, and security is tight (crucial for guest reviews).</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>If you want a high-yield property with lower management costs, Avenue-by-the-Sea is a winner. The Flat Rate model makes it mathematically superior to many other investments in town.</p>

<p><strong>Own a unit at Avenue-by-the-Sea?</strong> Don't pay 20% commission elsewhere.</p>
