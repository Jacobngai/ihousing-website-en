<p>When investing in Melaka property for Airbnb, the <strong>Airbnb Guest Selection Process</strong> is your first line of defense against property damage, noise complaints, and legal issues with Strata committees.</p>

<p>With iHousing's 8 years of experience managing 100+ properties across Melaka—from Silverscape to Parkland—we've developed a rigorous selection process that maintains a 4.9-star average across our portfolio while protecting owners' assets.</p>

<h2>1. The "Negative Space" Strategy: Reading Reviews Between the Lines</h2>
<p>Most hosts just look at the star rating. A 4.8-star guest looks fine, right? <strong>Wrong.</strong> In the Airbnb community, "Review Inflation" is real. We look for "polite warnings" like <em>"They were communicative throughout the stay"</em> (Translation: They complained about everything) or <em>"Better suited for guests who don't prioritize cleanliness"</em> (Translation: They left the place a disaster).</p>

<h2>2. The "Local Party" Filter (Essential for Melaka)</h2>
<p>Melaka is a weekend destination, making us prime targets for "Staycations" that are actually disguised parties. We send a "Pre-Stay Questionnaire" to every local weekend booking. If they ask about parking capacity for multiple cars or if there are "cameras in the hallway," our screening goes into overdrive.</p>

<h2>3. The "Communication Velocity" Test</h2>
<p>How a guest behaves *before* they book is a perfect predictor of how they will behave *during* their stay. Demanding guests who ask for 50% discounts or 10 AM check-ins are statistically the most likely to leave a 1-star review. We respond to inquiries within 5-15 minutes to set a professional tone immediately.</p>

<h2>4. Verification Beyond the App</h2>
<p>Airbnb’s "Government ID Verified" badge is just the start. At iHousing, we go further with professional background checks and maintaining an "Internal Blacklist" across our 100+ managed properties in Melaka. If a guest caused trouble at one unit, they won't be getting into another.</p>

<h2>5. The "Flat Fee" Integrity Rule</h2>
<p>Many property managers charge a 20-30% commission, which incentivizes them to accept *every* guest just to get their cut. <strong>iHousing operates on a Flat Management Fee.</strong> We have no incentive to "chase the money" by accepting a high-risk guest. We’d rather have your property empty for one night than have you spend RM5,000 on repairs.</p>
