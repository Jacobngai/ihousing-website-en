<h1>Switching Guide: Moving from Competitor to iHousing - Step by Step</h1>

<h2>How to Switch Airbnb Management Companies Without Losing Bookings or Income</h2>

<p>This step-by-step guide shows you exactly how to transition smoothly, with zero disruption to your bookings and income.</p>

<h2>Before You Switch: Preparation Steps</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Common Switching Concerns – Addressed</h2>

<h3>"Will I lose my Superhost status?"</h3>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Your Superhost status is attached to your listing, not your manager. We maintain or improve your ratings during transition.</p>

<h3>"What about existing guest reviews?"</h3>

<p><strong>All reviews stay.</strong> Reviews are property-specific. They don't disappear when you switch managers.</p>

<h3>"Will there be a gap in bookings?"</h3>

<p><strong>Never.</strong> We coordinate transition so your calendar is always active. No double-bookings, no gaps.</p>

<h3>"Is it worth the termination fee?"</h3>

<p><strong>Almost always yes.</strong> Most owners recoup termination fees within 2-3 months through lower management costs and higher revenue.</p>

<h2>Real Owner Switching Stories</h2>

<h3>"I Switched 3 Properties, Earned RM12,000 More in Year 1"</h3>

<p>"I was paying 25% commission plus markups. Switched all 3 condos to iHousing's flat fee model. Even with termination fees, I saved RM12,000 in the first year alone. My occupancy actually went up because iHousing is more proactive." – <strong>Chen, Melaka Raya</strong></p>

<h3>"No Disruption to Bookings, Just Better Service"</h3>

<p>"I was worried about switching during peak season, but iHousing made it seamless. They handled everything, my bookings continued without interruption, and I immediately started earning more." – <strong>Sarah, Banda Kaba</strong></p>
