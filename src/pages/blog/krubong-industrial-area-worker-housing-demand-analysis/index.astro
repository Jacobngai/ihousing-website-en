<h2>Revenue Performance: Krubong vs Tourist Areas</h2>

        <tr>
            <th>Metric</th>
            <th>Krubong Industrial</th>
            <th>Tourist Zone (Jonker)</th>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Average Occupancy Rate</td>
            <td>78%</td>
            <td>65%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Average Stay Duration</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Seasonal Variation</td>

            <td>Lower</td>
            <td>Higher</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Why Lower Seasonal Variation Matters</h2>

<p>The stability of corporate housing demand protects your investment from tourist market fluctuations. While Jonker Walk properties sit empty during low season, Krubong properties maintain consistent occupancy as factory operations continue year-round.</p>

<p>This stability translates to predictable monthly income, easier financial planning, and reduced stress from occupancy anxiety. Our Krubong property owners report greater peace of mind knowing their units generate reliable returns regardless of school holidays or seasonal trends.</p>

<h2>Investment Considerations for Krubong</h2>

<p>When evaluating properties in Krubong Industrial Area for Airbnb conversion:</p>

<h3>Property Types That Work Best</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Condominiums:</strong> 2-3 bedroom units appeal to teams and longer-stay managers</li>
    <li><strong>Service Apartments:</strong> Built-in amenities reduce setup costs</li>

</ul>

<h3>Key Location Factors</h3>

    <li>Accessible via main roads (avoid narrow interior roads)</li>
    <li>Near amenities (restaurants, convenience stores)</li>
    <li>Secure parking available</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rental Rate Strategy</h3>

    <li>2-bedroom: RM250-300/night</li>
    <li>3-bedroom: RM350-450/night</li>
    <li>Monthly packages: 20-30% discount on nightly rates</li>
