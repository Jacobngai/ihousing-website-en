<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">When Should You Raise Your Airbnb Prices in 2026?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>Chinese New Year (Feb 17-21) is the jackpot (3x normal rate). Hari Raya Puasa (Mar 20-22) is next (2.5x rate).</strong> The 2026 calendar is packed with long weekends. Smart hosts block these dates 6 months in advance to prevent "early bird" snipers from booking at low rates.</p>
</div>

<p>Revenue management is not just about getting bookings; it's about getting the <em>highest possible price</em> for your most valuable inventory.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we use dynamic pricing software that adjusts rates daily based on demand. For self-managers, here is the manual cheat sheet for 2026.</p>

<h2>The "Golden Weeks" (Do Not Discount!)</h2>

<h3>1. Chinese New Year (Feb 17 - Feb 21)</h3>
<p>The biggest week of the year. Demand is 500% above normal.
<br><strong>Strategy:</strong> Set Minimum Stay to 3 Nights. Price at RM 600+ for a 2BR condo (vs normal RM 200).</p>

<h3>2. Hari Raya Aidilfitri (Mar 20 - Mar 22)</h3>
<p>Families travel back to hometowns ("Balik Kampung"). Large units (3-4 bedrooms) sell out first.
<br><strong>Strategy:</strong> Focus on family amenities. Price at RM 500+.</p>

<h3>3. School Holidays (May 30 - June 14)</h3>
<p>The mid-year break. Consistent high demand from Singaporean families.
<br><strong>Strategy:</strong> Moderate price increase (1.5x), but focus on occupancy (7-night discounts).</p>

<h3>4. Year-End Holidays (Nov 21 - Dec 31)</h3>
<p>The marathon. Everyone is clearing annual leave.
<br><strong>Strategy:</strong> Keep rates high on weekends (Fri-Sun) but offer aggressive discounts for Mon-Thu to fill the gaps.</p>

<h2>The "Long Weekend" Trap</h2>

<p>In 2026, Malaysia has several 3-day weekends due to public holidays falling on Fridays or Mondays.</p>

<h2>The "Early Bird" Mistake</h2>

<p>Many hosts open their calendar 12 months in advance with a flat rate.
<br><strong>Scenario:</strong> You list your unit for RM 200/night.
<br><strong>Result:</strong> A savvy guest books your unit for CNY 2026 in June 2025. You just lost RM 1,200 in potential revenue.</p>

<p><strong>iHousing Solution:</strong> We block calendars beyond 3 months OR set an artificially high price (RM 999) for far-out dates until we know the market demand.</p>

<h2>Last-Minute Strategy (The "Fill or Kill")</h2>

<p>If your unit is empty 3 days before a peak weekend, drop the price by 10% daily. Revenue of RM 150 is better than RM 0.</p>

<p><strong>Don't leave money on the table.</strong> Let algorithms set your price.</p>
