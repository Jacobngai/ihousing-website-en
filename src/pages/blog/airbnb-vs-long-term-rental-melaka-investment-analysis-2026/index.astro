<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Is Airbnb or Long-Term Rental More Profitable in Melaka (2026)?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>Short-term rental wins on yield (7-11% ROI) vs. long-term (3-4% ROI).</strong> In 2026, Melaka's tourism boom means a well-managed Airbnb can generate 2-3x the monthly revenue of a standard yearly lease. However, Airbnb requires active management, whereas long-term is passive but lower return.</p>
</div>

<p>Every property investor faces this dilemma. Do you sign a 12-month tenancy agreement for a stable check, or do you chase the higher upside of the short-term market?</p>

<p>At iHousing, we have crunched the numbers from hundreds of units across Melaka. Here is the data-driven reality.</p>

<h2>The Financial Breakdown: A Tale of Two Strategies</h2>

<p>Let's take a standard 2-bedroom unit at <strong>The Apple</strong> or <strong>Atlantis Residences</strong> as a case study.</p>

<h2>The "Hidden" Benefits of Airbnb</h2>

<p>Beyond just the money, short-term rental offers strategic advantages:</p>

<h3>1. Property Condition</h3>
<p>In a long-term rental, you don't see the inside of your unit for a year. The tenant could be smoking inside, keeping pets, or neglecting cleaning.
<br>In an Airbnb, the unit is <strong>professionally cleaned every 2-3 days</strong>. Minor repairs (leaky faucet, loose handle) are fixed immediately by our team, keeping the property in showroom condition.</p>

<h3>2. Payment Security</h3>
<p>Evicting a non-paying tenant in Malaysia is a nightmare that can take 6-12 months.
<br>With Airbnb, <strong>payment is collected upfront</strong>. No chasing rent. No excuses.</p>

<h3>3. Flexibility</h3>
<p>Want to use your unit for a family gathering during Chinese New Year? With a tenant, you can't. With iHousing, you simply block the calendar dates.</p>

<h2>When Should You Choose Long-Term?</h2>

<p>Airbnb isn't for everyone. Long-term might be better if:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Location is Weak:</strong> If your condo is far from tourist hotspots (e.g., deeply residential areas in Bukit Baru or Peringgit), demand might be too low.</li>
    <li><strong>Old Building:</strong> Some older apartments (e.g., <strong>Pangsapuri Laksamana</strong>) have strict management or poor facilities that don't appeal to tourists.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Aversion:</strong> If you absolutely cannot handle income fluctuation (e.g., earning RM 3,000 in December but only RM 1,500 in Ramadan).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why iHousing Outperforms Self-Management</h2>

<p>Many owners try Airbnb, fail, and switch back to long-term because it's "too much work."</p>
<p>They are right. Cleaning, messaging guests at midnight, and managing pricing across 5 platforms is a full-time job.</p>
<p><strong>iHousing solves this.</strong> We take over the entire operation for a management fee, giving you the high returns of Airbnb with the passivity of a long-term lease.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In 2026, with Melaka's tourism numbers hitting new highs, leaving a prime condo on a long-term lease is leaving money on the table.</p>
