<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">TL;DR: The 2026 Location Verdict</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>Jonker Area (Heritage Zone):</strong> 85%+ occupancy, high turnover, ideal for small groups/couples. Best for steady cash flow.
<br><strong>Klebang Area (Coastal Belt):</strong> 65% occupancy, higher nightly rates (RM350+), ideal for large families. Best for higher ADR and capital appreciation.</p>
</div>

<p>Every investor asks: "Where is the hotspot?" In Melaka, the battle is between the historic center (Jonker/Kota Laksamana) and the emerging coastal belt (Klebang/Limbongan).</p>

<p>At iHousing, we manage 100+ properties in both zones. Here is the 2026 insider comparison based on real revenue data.</p>

<h2>Zone 1: The Heart of Action (Jonker / Kota Laksamana)</h2>

<p>This includes <strong>The Wave</strong>, <strong>Atlantis</strong>, and <strong>The Apple</strong>. It is the default choice for first-time visitors.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Insane demand. Weekends are always full. Easy to market. Highest yield per square foot.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Traffic is a nightmare. Parking is scarce. Noise complaints are common. High maintenance due to turnover frequency.</li>
    <li><strong>Tenant Profile:</strong> Young couples, backpackers, small families (short stays, 1-2 nights).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zone 2: The Family Retreat (Klebang / Limbongan)</h2>

<p>This includes <strong>Riviera Suites</strong> and <strong>Avenue-by-the-Sea</strong>. It is where repeat visitors and Singaporeans go to relax.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Quiet. Beach access. Bigger units (3-4 bedrooms). Higher nightly rate per booking. Easier parking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires a car. Lower occupancy on weekdays (30-40%).</li>
    <li><strong>Tenant Profile:</strong> Big multi-generational families (Grandma + Kids), Singaporeans driving up for the weekend.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Traffic Factor</h2>

<p>Do not underestimate Melaka's traffic. Getting from Klebang to Jonker on a Saturday night can take 45 minutes. Guests staying in Klebang usually skip Jonker and stick to the <strong>Klebang Coconut Shake</strong> area or drive to <strong>Porta de Santiago</strong> early morning.</p>

<p><strong>iHousing Strategy:</strong> For Klebang properties, we market "Staycation" packages (board games, BBQ pits, beach gear) because guests spend more time <em>inside</em> the unit. For Jonker properties, we focus on <strong>walking distance</strong> convenience.</p>
