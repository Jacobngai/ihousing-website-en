<h1>Commission vs Flat Fee: What 50+ Owners Say After 1 Year</h1>

<h2>We Surveyed 50+ Melaka Airbnb Owners. Here's What They Told Us.</h2>

<p>When choosing an Airbnb management company, most owners focus on one number: the management fee percentage.</p>

<p><strong>Commission model:</strong> "20% of revenue"</p>
<p><strong>Flat fee model:</strong> "RM250/month"</p>

<p>On the surface, commission seems attractive - "you only pay when you earn." But after 12 months of real operation, the story changes dramatically.</p>

<p>We interviewed 50+ Melaka Airbnb owners who switched from commission-based management to iHousing's flat fee model (or vice versa). Their insights after one full year of operation reveal surprising truths about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hidden costs that weren't discussed upfront</li>
  <li>Service quality differences</li>
  <li>Actual savings (or losses)</li>
  <li>Owner satisfaction levels</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is what they wish they knew before signing.</strong></p>

<h2>The Survey: Who We Interviewed</h2>

<h3>Owner Profile</h3>

<p><strong>50 Melaka Airbnb owners, all with:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Properties in Melaka Raya, Jonker Walk, Alor Gajah, and coastal areas</li>
  <li>At least 1 year of Airbnb hosting experience</li>
  <li>Experience with both commission and flat fee management</li>
  <li>Annual revenue between RM8,000-25,000</li>
</ul>

<h3>Property Types</h3>
<ul>
  <li>60%: 2-bedroom condos</li>
  <li>25%: 3-bedroom condos</li>
  <li>10%: 1-bedroom studios</li>
  <li>5%: Heritage shophouses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding #1: Hidden Costs Were the Biggest Complaint</h2>

<h3>What Commission-Model Owners Discovered</h3>

<p><strong>The marketing pitch:</strong> "You only pay 20% when you earn."</p>

<p><strong>The reality after 1 year:</strong></p>

<h4>Hidden Cost #1: Cleaning Markups</h4>

<p><strong>What they were told:</strong> "Cleaning is included in your fee."</p>

<p><strong>What they experienced:</strong></p>
<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scenario</th>
      <th>What They Thought</th>
      <th>What They Paid</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cleaning per stay</td>
      <td>"Included in 20%"</td>
      <td>RM80-120 charged separately</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Markup on cleaning</td>
      <td>"None mentioned"</td>
      <td>30-50% above actual cost</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Annual impact (40 stays)</td>
      <td>RM0</td>
      <td>RM1,200-2,400 in extra charges</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Owner quote:</strong> "I thought the 20% covered everything. Then I saw RM120 cleaning charges on every stay. When I asked, they said 'cleaning is separate.' That was never explained during the sales pitch."</p>

<h4>Hidden Cost #2: Maintenance Margins</h4>

<p><strong>What they were told:</strong> "We handle maintenance for you."</p>

<p><strong>What they experienced:</strong></p>
<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Repair</th>
      <th>Actual Contractor Cost</th>
      <th>What Owner Was Charged</th>
      <td>Markup</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>AC repair</td>
      <td>RM250</td>
      <td>RM300</td>
      <td>20%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Plumbing fix</td>
      <td>RM180</td>
      <td>RM220</td>
      <td>22%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Door replacement</td>
      <td>RM600</td>
      <td>RM750</td>
      <td>25%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Owner quote:</strong> "I found the plumber's receipt in my mailbox. They charged me RM300 but the invoice showed RM180. When I asked, they said 'coordination fee.' But I was already paying 20% management fee!"</p>

<h4>Hidden Cost #3: Emergency Call Fees</h4>

<p><strong>Pattern:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Guest calls at 10 PM with locked out</li>
  <li>Manager charges RM50-100 "after-hours fee"</li>
  <li>Happens 5-10 times per year</li>
  <li><strong>Annual cost: RM250-1,000</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Owner quote:</strong> "I understand emergency calls cost money. But these fees were never disclosed upfront. It feels like nickel-and-diming."</p>

<h2>Finding #2: Service Quality Diverged Significantly</h2>

<h3>Commission Model: High Revenue, Low Profit Focus</h3>

<p><strong>Owner observation:</strong> "My commission-based manager was great at getting bookings. Revenue was high. But profit was disappointing because of all the extra charges."</p>

<p><strong>Pattern:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Incentive:</strong> Commission managers earn more when you earn more</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Aggressive pricing, high occupancy focus</li>
  <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> More bookings = more opportunity for markups and fees</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flat Fee Model: Profit Focus</h3>

<p><strong>Owner observation:</strong> "My flat fee manager (iHousing) doesn't make more from higher revenue. Their focus is on efficiency and keeping my costs down."</p>

<p><strong>Pattern:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Incentive:</strong> Flat regardless of revenue</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Cost control, efficiency focus</li>
  <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> No incentive to inflate costs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Owner quote:</strong> "With commission, they'd suggest premium cleaning 'for better reviews.' With flat fee, they find cost-effective solutions because they don't profit from spending my money."</p>

<h2>Finding #3: Actual Cost Comparison After 1 Year</h2>

<h3>Case Study: 2BR Melaka Raya Condo</h3>

<p><strong>Property profile:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Annual revenue: RM15,000</li>
  <li>40 bookings per year</li>
  <li>Average stay: 4 nights</li>
</ul>

</table>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> On a RM15,000 revenue property, flat fee delivered <strong>RM3,350 more profit</strong> - a 77% increase.</p>

<h2>Finding #4: Revenue Performance Was Similar</h2>

<h3>Booking and Occupancy: No Significant Difference</h3>

<p><strong>Survey finding:</strong> After 1 year, both models delivered similar occupancy.</p>

      <td>RM15,000</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p><strong>Owner insight:</strong> "I worried flat fee would mean less effort on bookings. But iHousing's 5-platform listing and dynamic pricing delivered same occupancy. The difference was in costs, not revenue."</p>

<h2>Finding #5: Owner Satisfaction Diverged Sharply</h2>

<h3>Key Satisfaction Themes</h3>

<h4>Commission Model Complaints</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"Felt like they were always finding ways to charge me more"</li>
  <li>"Revenue looked great but profit was disappointing"</li>
  <li>"Never knew what my next bill would include"</li>
  <li>"Questioned if they had my best interests at heart"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Flat Fee Model Praise</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"Predictable costs every month"</li>
  <li>"They don't profit from spending my money"</li>
  <li>"Transparent reporting - I know exactly where my money goes"</li>
  <li>"Focus on efficiency, not just revenue"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding #6: The "Break-Even" Point Surprise</h2>

<h3>Where Does Commission Beat Flat Fee?</h3>

<p><strong>Mathematical reality:</strong> At a certain revenue level, commission becomes cheaper than flat fee.</p>

<p><strong>The break-even calculation:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Flat fee: RM3,000/year</li>
  <li>Commission rate: 20%</li>
  <li>Break-even: RM15,000 annual revenue</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Below RM15,000/year:</strong> Flat fee is cheaper</p>
<p><strong>Above RM15,000/year:</strong> Commission is theoretically cheaper</p>

<h3>But Here's What Owners Actually Experienced</h3>

<p><strong>The catch:</strong> Commission models only charge 20% on base revenue. But they ALSO charge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cleaning markups (30-50%)</li>
  <li>Maintenance margins (15-25%)</li>
  <li>Emergency fees (RM50-100 each)</li>
  <li>Supply markups (15-30%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Effective commission rate:</strong> Most owners reported their TOTAL costs (including hidden charges) equaled 28-35% of revenue, not the advertised 20%.</p>

<p><strong>New break-even point:</strong> With effective 30% total cost, flat fee beats commission even at RM25,000+ annual revenue for most properties.</p>

<h2>Finding #7: Switching Dynamics</h2>

<h3>Commission → Flat Fee Switchers</h3>

<p><strong>35 owners switched from commission to flat fee</strong></p>

<p><strong>Primary reasons:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Tired of hidden fees (80%)</li>
  <li>Unpredictable monthly costs (70%)</li>
  <li>Questioned if manager had aligned incentives (65%)</li>
  <li>Friend recommended flat fee model (45%)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>After 1 year with flat fee:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>92% satisfied with switch</li>
  <li>Average profit increase: RM2,800-4,500/year</li>
  <li>Top comment: "I wish I'd started with flat fee from day one"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flat Fee → Commission Switchers</h3>

<p><strong>5 owners switched from flat fee to commission</strong></p>

<p><strong>Primary reasons:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Wanted more aggressive revenue focus (60%)</li>
  <li>Thought commission would be cheaper for high-revenue property (40%)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>After 1 year with commission:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>40% returned to flat fee model</li>
  <li>Main regret: "Didn't realize how much hidden costs would add up"</li>
  <li>Those who stayed: Had very high-revenue properties (RM30,000+), accepted trade-offs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding #8: Communication Differences</h2>

<h3>Commission Model Communication</h3>

<p><strong>Owner experiences:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Frequent updates about bookings and revenue</li>
  <li>Less transparent about costs</li>
  <li>Upsell suggestions common ("premium cleaning," "professional photos," etc.)</li>
  <li>Focus on revenue metrics in reports</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Owner quote:</strong> "They'd celebrate RM20,000 revenue but my profit was only RM8,000. Focused on the wrong number."</p>

<h3>Flat Fee Model Communication</h3>

<p><strong>Owner experiences (iHousing):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Transparent cost breakdowns</li>
  <li>Efficiency focus ("saved RM500 on bulk supplies")</li>
  <li>No upsells (doesn't profit from extra spending)</li>
  <li>Reports focus on NET income, not just revenue</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Owner quote:</strong> "Their report shows 'RM12,000 to you' not 'RM18,000 revenue, RM6,000 costs.' Focus is on what I keep."</p>

<h2>Finding #9: Long-Term Relationship Patterns</h2>

<h3>After 1 Year, Who Stayed?</h3>

<p><strong>Commission model:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>68% renewal rate</li>
  <li>Main reason for leaving: Hidden costs and unpredictability</li>
  <li>Those who stayed: High-revenue properties, tolerated complexity for better service</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flat fee model (iHousing):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>94% renewal rate</li>
  <li>Main reason for staying: Transparency and predictable costs</li>
  <li>Those who left: Wanted more aggressive revenue focus (switched to commission)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding #10: What Owners Would Tell New Investors</h2>

<h3>Advice from 50 Owners with 1+ Years Experience</h3>

<p><strong>To new Melaka Airbnb investors:</strong></p>

<h4>"Ask About Hidden Costs" (45 owners mentioned this)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"Don't just ask about the management fee percentage"</li>
  <li>"Ask: What ELSE will I be charged for?"</li>
  <li>"Get cleaning costs in writing"</li>
  <li>"Ask about maintenance markup policy"</li>
  <li>"Request sample monthly statements"</li>
</ul>

<h4>"Understand the Incentive Structure" (38 owners)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"Commission managers profit from your spending"</li>
  <li>"Flat fee managers profit from efficiency"</li>
  <li>"Choose the incentive alignment that fits your goals"</li>
</ul>

<h4>"Run the Numbers With ALL Costs" (42 owners)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"Don't compare just management fees"</li>
  <li>"Compare TOTAL annual costs including everything"</li>
  <li>"Ask for a 12-month projection"</li>
</ul>

<h4>"Trust Your Gut" (29 owners)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"If the sales pitch feels too good to be true, it probably is"</li>
  <li>"Transparency matters more than the lowest advertised rate"</li>
  <li>"You need to trust your manager with your investment"</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Verdict: What the Data Shows</h2>

<h3>For Most Melaka Properties: Flat Fee Wins</h3>

<p><strong>Why flat fee outperformed for 80%+ of surveyed owners:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>No hidden costs:</strong> In-house cleaning, no maintenance markups, no emergency fees</li>
  <li><strong>Predictable expenses:</strong> Same fee every month, easier budgeting</li>
  <li><strong>Aligned incentives:</strong> Manager doesn't profit from spending your money</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear reporting on actual costs and net income</li>
  <li><strong>Effective commission rate:</strong> When all costs included, flat fee = 18-22% effective rate vs 28-35% for commission models</li>
</ol>

<h3>Commission Model Makes Sense For:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Very high-revenue properties (RM30,000+/year) where commission percentage is lower than effective flat fee percentage</li>
  <li>Owners who want aggressive revenue focus and are willing to accept higher costs for potentially higher bookings</li>
  <li>Situations where property needs significant improvement and owner is willing to pay premium for better performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Choose: Decision Framework</h2>

<h3>Choose Commission If:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your property earns RM30,000+/year annually</li>
  <li>You prioritize maximum revenue over profit</li>
  <li>You're willing to accept complexity for potentially better service</li>
  <li>You've verified all potential hidden costs and are comfortable with them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Choose Flat Fee If:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your property earns under RM30,000/year (most Melaka condos)</li>
  <li>You prioritize predictable costs and transparency</li>
  <li>You want aligned incentives (manager profits from efficiency, not spending)</li>
  <li>You value simplicity and clear reporting</li>
</ul>
