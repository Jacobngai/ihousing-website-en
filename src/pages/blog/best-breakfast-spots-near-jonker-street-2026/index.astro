<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Where is the Best Breakfast Near Jonker Street in 2026?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>For traditional Hainanese vibes, go to <em>Lung Ann Refreshments</em>. For Dim Sum, hit <em>Low Yong Moh</em>. For a modern brunch, <em>The Daily Fix</em> remains the champion.</strong> Melaka's breakfast scene is legendary, but the queues can be brutal. As a host, guiding your guests to the right spot at the right time is a 5-star service move.</p>
</div>

<p>Nothing starts a vacation day better than a great meal. In Melaka, breakfast isn't just sustenance; it's a ritual. Whether your guests are staying at a heritage shophouse on <strong>Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock</strong> or a condo at <strong>The Apple</strong>, they will ask you: "Where should we eat?"</p>

<p>At iHousing, we provide a digital "Local Eats" guidebook to every guest. Here are our top picks for 2026.</p>

<h2>The Classics: Coffee, Toast, and Eggs</h2>

<h3>1. Lung Ann Refreshments</h3>
<p>This is the real deal. No air-conditioning, mosaic floor tiles, and the smell of charcoal-toasted bread. It's located right next to the Satay Celup shops.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Kaya Butter Toast (Roti Bakar), Half-boiled Eggs, Kopi C.</li>
    <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Go before 8:30 AM. After 9:00 AM, the queue spills onto the street.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Low Yong Moh Restaurant</h3>
<p>The oldest Dim Sum spot in town. It's chaotic, loud, and delicious. You share tables with strangers, which is part of the charm.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Big Pau (Tai Pau), Siew Mai, Char Siew Pau.</li>
    <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> It opens at 6:00 AM. Seriously, go early. By 8:00 AM, items start selling out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Modern Cafes: Pancakes and Lattes</h2>

<h3>3. The Daily Fix Cafe</h3>
<p>Hidden inside a vintage souvenir shop on <strong>Jonker Street</strong> (Jalan Hang Jebat), this place put Melaka cafes on the map. The interior is a lush, green courtyard that feels miles away from the busy street.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Pandan Pancakes (fluffy and fragrant), Gula Melaka Latte.</li>
    <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Put your name on the waiting list and browse the shop downstairs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Heesan Kopi</h3>
<p>Cool mural art and a relaxed vibe. A great alternative if The Daily Fix is too crowded.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Nyonya Laksa, Salted Egg Yolk Croissant.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The "Eat Like a Local" Comparison</h2>

<p>Help your guests choose based on their mood (and patience level).</p>
