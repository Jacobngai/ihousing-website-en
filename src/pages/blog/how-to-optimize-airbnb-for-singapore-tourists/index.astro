<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">What Do Singaporean Guests Want in Melaka?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>They want four things: 1. Listing on Agoda (their preferred app), 2. Arctic-level Air Conditioning (20°C or bust), 3. A curated Food Guide (Hawker Stalls > fancy cafes), and 4. Secure Parking for their Singapore-plate cars.</strong> Crack this code, and you will have 5-star reviews and repeat bookings all year round.</p>
</div>

<p>For Melaka hosts, the Singaporean market is the holy grail. They visit year-round, spend well on food, and refer their friends. But they are also demanding. If your unit isn't up to "Singapore Standard," they will let you know in the review.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we manage properties specifically tailored for this demographic. Here is our playbook.</p>

<h2>The "Agoda" Factor</h2>

<p>If you are only on Airbnb, you are invisible to 60% of Singaporeans. They love <strong>Agoda</strong> because of its points system and familiarity.
<br><strong>iHousing Strategy:</strong> We ensure your property is a "Preferred Partner" on Agoda to appear at the top of search results for Melaka.</p>

<h2>The "Ice Cold" AC Rule</h2>

<p>Singaporeans live in air-conditioning. Melaka's heat is their enemy.
<br><strong>The Complaint:</strong> "The AC took too long to cool down."
<br><strong>The Fix:</strong> Service your AC units every 3 months. Set the remote to 18°C before they arrive. Install a ceiling fan to circulate the cool air faster.</p>

<h2>Secure Parking is Non-Negotiable</h2>

<p>Many drive up in expensive cars. They are terrified of theft or scratches.
<br><strong>Must-Have:</strong> A designated, covered parking spot within the condo (like at <strong>The Apple</strong> or <strong>Atlantis</strong>). Street parking is a deal-breaker.</p>

<h2>The Food Guide (Hawker > Hipster)</h2>

<p>Singapore has great cafes. They don't come to Melaka for avocado toast; they come for <strong>authentic Nyonya food</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Guide for:</strong></p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Best Chendol:</strong> (Hint: It's usually a roadside stall, not a restaurant).</li>
    <li><strong>Satay Celup:</strong> Recommend a spot with a shorter queue than Capitol.</li>
    <li><strong>Chicken Rice Balls:</strong> The ultimate debate. Pick a side (Chung Wah vs. Ee Ji Ban).</li>
</ul>

<h2>iHousing's "Singapore Standard" Cleaning</h2>

<p>We train our cleaners to spot what a Singaporean auntie would spot: dust on the fan blades, water marks on the tap, and hair in the drain. Passing the "Auntie Test" guarantees a 5-star review.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Cater to Singaporeans, and your weekend occupancy is guaranteed. Ignore their preferences, and you fight for the scraps.</p>
