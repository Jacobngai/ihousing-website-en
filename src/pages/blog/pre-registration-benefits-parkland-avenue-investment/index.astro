<h1>Parkland Avenue Pre-Registration Benefits: Why Lock In Your Rate Now</h1>

<h2>Why Do Smart Property Investors Pre-Register for Parkland Avenue?</h2>

<p>Parkland Avenue by the Sea is Melaka's most anticipated beachfront Airbnb development. As the official Airbnb manager, iHousing is offering exclusive pre-registration benefits that will NEVER be available after launch.</p>

<p>Pre-registrants lock in lifetime flat fee pricing. Public buyers pay market rates. The difference could cost you thousands over your investment lifetime.</p>

<p>Here's everything you need to know about pre-registration—and why you should act NOW.</p>

<h2>What Is Parkland Avenue by the Sea?</h2>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Pantai Kundur, Melaka (prime beachfront)</p>

<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Established Melaka developer with 15+ year track record</p>

<p><strong>Unit Types:</strong> 1BR, 2BR, 3BR condos (500-1,200 sqft)</p>

<p><strong>Target Completion:</strong> August 2026</p>

<p><strong>Official Airbnb Manager:</strong> iHousing (exclusive appointment)</p>

<p><strong>Investment Case:</strong> Beachfront properties in Melaka are scarce. Pantai Kundur is up-and-coming. Weekend tourists from KL and Singapore LOVE beach getaways. This is positioned as Melaka's premier coastal Airbnb destination.</p>

<h2>Pre-Registration vs. Public Pricing</h2>

<p>The biggest pre-registration benefit? LIFETIME flat fee pricing lock:</p>

<p><strong>10-year savings:</strong> Pre-registrants save RM18,000-24,000 compared to public buyers. This is pure profit that goes directly to YOUR bottom line.</p>

<h2>Complete Pre-Registration Benefits Package</h2>

<h3>1. Lifetime Flat Fee Lock</h3>

<p>Your rate NEVER increases. Ever. Even if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We raise prices for new owners in 2028</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Value:</strong> Price protection against future increases. RM18,000-24,000 saved over 10 years.</p>

<h3>2. Priority Unit Selection</h3>

<p>Pre-registrants choose units BEFORE public launch. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Best floor levels (higher floors = better views)</li>
  <li>Best orientations (facing sea = premium pricing power)</li>
  <li>Best layouts (corner units = more space)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>Value:</strong> Risk-free launch. Maximum RM1,800 fee protection during ramp-up period.</p>

<h2>Pre-Registration FAQ</h2>

<h3>Q: Is pre-registration binding?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> No. The RM1,000 deposit is 100% refundable if you decide not to proceed. Pre-registration simply gives you priority access and benefits.</p>

<h3>Q: What if construction is delayed?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Your pre-registration benefits remain valid regardless of construction timeline. You're locked in for whenever the project completes.</p>

<h3>Q: Can I transfer my pre-registration?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. If you sell your pre-registration rights to another investor, all benefits transfer to the new owner (this adds resale value to your spot).</p>

<h3>Q: What if I want more than one unit?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> You can pre-register for up to 3 units. Each unit gets the same benefits. Popular for portfolio investors.</p>

<h3>Q: Do pre-registrants get priority for future phases?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. If Parkland Avenue launches Phase 2, pre-registrants from Phase 1 get first access + same pricing benefits.</p>
