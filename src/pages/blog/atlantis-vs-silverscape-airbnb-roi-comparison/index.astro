<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Atlantis or Silverscape: Who Wins the ROI Battle?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>It depends on your target market. Atlantis wins on volume (families love the pool), while Silverscape wins on rate (couples pay for the view).</strong> In 2026, our data shows Atlantis averaging 75% occupancy at RM220/night, while Silverscape hits 65% occupancy at RM260/night. Both deliver solid 8-10% ROI, but the guest profile is completely different.</p>

<p>If you are buying an investment property in Melaka, you have likely narrowed it down to the "Big Two": <strong>Atlantis Residences</strong> in Kota Laksamana or <strong>Silverscape (Hatten City)</strong> in Melaka Raya. Both are giants in the short-term rental market.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we manage over 50 units in each building. We see the daily numbers. Here is the unbiased truth about which one makes more money.</p>

<h2>The Contenders</h2>

<h3>Atlantis Residences (Kota Laksamana)</h3>
<p><strong>The Family Fortress.</strong> Famous for its massive water park pool, it is the default choice for families with kids.
<br><strong>Pros:</strong> Huge demand during school holidays. High repeat bookings.
<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Competitive (lots of listings). Wear and tear is higher due to kids.</p>

<h3>Silverscape Residence (Melaka Raya)</h3>
<p><strong>The Sky-High Luxury.</strong> Sitting above Elements Mall with an infinity pool overlooking the Straits of Melaka.
<br><strong>Pros:</strong> Premium appeal. Attracts couples and business travelers. Stunning sunset views.
<br><strong>Cons:</strong> The mall below is quiet. Lift waiting times can be long during peak weekends.</p>

<h2>Location Strategy</h2>

<p><strong>Atlantis:</strong> Located in Kota Laksamana, it is closer to the foodie hotspots (Jonker Street is a 5-min Grab ride). However, traffic can be gridlocked on weekends.</p>
<p><strong>Silverscape:</strong> Located in Melaka Raya, it is slightly further south. It's quieter but requires a longer drive to reach Jonker. However, it's closer to the Portuguese Settlement.</p>

<h2>Which One Should You Buy?</h2>

<p><strong>Buy Atlantis IF:</strong> You want consistent bookings year-round and don't mind a bit more wear and tear. Families are loyal; if the kids love the pool, they return every year.</p>

<p><strong>Buy Silverscape IF:</strong> You want a "trophy property" with a view. It attracts a slightly higher-spending demographic who are generally cleaner and quieter (fewer parties).</p>

<h2>The iHousing Verdict</h2>

<p>Both are excellent investments in 2026. The choice comes down to your risk appetite and management preference.</p>
