        <h2>Airbnb vs Long-Term Rental: 3-Year Income Comparison</h2>
        <p>Let's run the numbers on a RM300,000 condo in Melaka. Which model generates more wealth over 3 years?</p>
        <h3>Scenario: 2-Bedroom Condo in Bandar Hilir</h3>
        <strong>Long-Term Rental Model:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Monthly rent: RM1,800</li>
        <li>Tenant occupancy: ~95% (realistic)</li>
        <li>Vacancy between tenants: 1 month/year</li>
        <li>Maintenance: Tenant handles minor issues</li>
        <li>Annual income: RM20,520</li>
        <li><strong>3-Year Total: RM61,560</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Airbnb Model (Professionally Managed):</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Average daily rate: RM200</li>

        <strong>The Difference:</strong> Airbnb earns <strong>+RM10,400-28,400 more over 3 years</strong>
        <p>This doesn't even account for:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Appreciation:</strong> Airbnb properties are often better maintained</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can use the condo whenever you want (just block dates)</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Adjust pricing based on demand, events, seasons</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Calculate Your Condo's Airbnb Potential</h2>
        <p>Use this simple estimator to gauge your Melaka condo's potential:</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Select Your Unit Type</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Unit Type</th><th>Base Monthly Income</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Studio (400-600 sqft)</td><td>RM400-700</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1 Bedroom (600-800 sqft)</td><td>RM600-900</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2 Bedroom (800-1,000 sqft)</td><td>RM700-1,100</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3 Bedroom (1,000+ sqft)</td><td>RM900-1,400</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h3>Step 2: Apply Location Multiplier</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Location</th><th>Multiplier</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Jonker Street / UNESCO Area</td><td>x 1.3</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Bandar Hilir</td><td>x 1.1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Melaka Raya</td><td>x 1.0</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Ayer Keroh</td><td>x 0.9</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Klebang Beach</td><td>x 1.0</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h3>Step 3: Estimate Annual Income</h3>
        <strong>Formula:</strong> Base Monthly × Location Multiplier × 12 = Annual Estimate
        <strong>Example Calculation:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>2BR condo (base: RM900/month)</li>
        <li>Location: Bandar Hilir (multiplier: 1.1)</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Income: RM900 × 1.1 × 12 = RM11,880</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These are estimates based on market averages. Actual results vary based on furnishing quality, listing quality, reviews, and management effectiveness.
        <h2>Factors That Increase Your Airbnb Income</h2>

        <strong>Impact:</strong> Listings with pro photos get 20%+ more bookings.
        <h3>2. Dynamic Pricing (+15% revenue)</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>Weekends: 30-50% higher than weekdays</li>
        <li>Holidays: 50-100% higher (CNY, school holidays)</li>
        <li>Events: Premium pricing during festivals</li>
        <li>Low season: Competitive pricing to maintain occupancy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Don't rely only on Airbnb:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> 40-50% of bookings</li>
        <li><strong>Booking.com:</strong> 20-30% of bookings</li>
        <li><strong>Agoda:</strong> 10-15% of bookings</li>
        <li><strong>VRBO / Expedia:</strong> 10-15% of bookings</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> 5-platform listings get 60%+ more bookings than single-platform.
        <h3>4. Superhost Status (+10% premium pricing)</h3>
        <p>Earning Superhost status requires:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>4.8+ overall rating</li>

        <li>&lt;1% cancellation rate</li>

        <li>4.8+ rating is the sweet spot</li>

        <strong>Impact:</strong> Higher-rated listings appear first in search results.

        <li>Parking (crucial in Melaka)</li>
        <li>Washer (for stays 3+ nights)</li>

        <strong>Impact:</strong> Missing amenities = lost bookings to competitors.
        <h2>Seasonal Variations: What to Expect Month-by-Month</h2>

        <strong>Occupancy:</strong> 15-18%
        <strong>ADR:</strong> -10-20% vs. average

        <li>Hotter weather</li>
        <li>Fewer domestic tourists</li>
        </ul>
