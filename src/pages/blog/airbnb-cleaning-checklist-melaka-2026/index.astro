<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">What Must Be on Every Melaka Airbnb Cleaning Checklist?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>Start with the sand and end with the grout.</strong> In Melaka, 2026 cleaning standards demand attention to: 1. <strong>Floors</strong> (sand from Klebang Beach is everywhere), 2. <strong>Bathroom Grout</strong> (high humidity causes rapid mold growth), 3. <strong>High-Touch Surfaces</strong> (remotes/switches), 4. <strong>Linen Stains</strong> (sunscreen/makeup), and 5. <strong>The Fridge</strong> (leftover durian smell kills reviews).</p>
</div>

<p>Cleanliness is the single biggest factor in guest satisfaction. You can have a stunning view of the Straits of Melaka, but if a guest finds a single hair on the pillow, your rating tanks. In 2026, guests are more hygiene-conscious than ever.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we manage housekeeping for hundreds of units. Our teams don't just "clean"; they <strong>reset</strong> the property to showroom condition. Here is the checklist we use.</p>

<h2>Zone 1: The "Sand Trap" (Living Area & Entry)</h2>

<p>Melaka is a coastal city. Guests visit <strong>Klebang Beach</strong> or <strong>Pantai Puteri</strong> and track sand into your unit. Sweeping is not enough.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Vacuum First:</strong> Vacuum rugs, sofa crevices, and corners <em>before</em> mopping. Wet sand is impossible to remove.</li>
    <li><strong>Mop with Disinfectant:</strong> Use a fresh mop head. If the water turns grey, change it.</li>
    <li><strong>Check the Sofa Bed:</strong> Pull it out. Guests often leave crumbs (or worse) in the folds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zone 2: The Humidity Battle (Bathroom)</h2>

<p>Melaka is humid. Mold grows fast in shower corners.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Grout Scrub:</strong> Use a stiff brush and mold remover on tile grout every single turnover.</li>
    <li><strong>Glass Screens:</strong> Remove water spots/calcium buildup.</li>
    <li><strong>Hair Check:</strong> Check the drain trap and the floor behind the toilet.</li>
    <li><strong>Toilet Seal:</strong> Sanitize the flush handle and the seat hinges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zone 3: The Sleep Sanctuary (Bedroom)</h2>

<p>Stained sheets are an instant refund request.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li><strong>The 3-Set Rule:</strong> Always have 3 sets of linens per bed (one on the bed, one in the wash, one in storage).</li>
    <li><strong>Pillow Protectors:</strong> Wash these frequently. Yellow sweat stains are unacceptable.</li>
    <li><strong>Under the Bed:</strong> Flash a light. Guests drop chargers, socks, and water bottles there constantly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Realistic Cleaning Times</h2>

<p>How long should it take? If your cleaner says they finished a 3-bedroom condo in 45 minutes, they cut corners.</p>

<td class="p-4 border border-gray-200">4+ Hours</td>
<td class="p-4 border border-gray-200">Full Day</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h2>The "Smell Test"</h2>

<p>Before leaving, do a smell check. 
<br><strong>Common Culprits:</strong> Durian in the fridge, damp towels in the hamper, or stale cigarette smoke on the balcony. 
<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Use an enzyme-based odor eliminator, not just air freshener (which just masks the smell).</p>

<h2>Why iHousing's Team is Different</h2>

<p>Finding reliable freelance cleaners in Melaka is hard. They cancel last minute, run out of supplies, or miss spots.</p>

<p>iHousing employs a dedicated, trained housekeeping team. We supply industrial-grade chemicals, high-power vacuums, and we conduct <strong>random spot checks</strong> to ensure standards are met.</p>

<p><strong>Stop stressing about cleaning.</strong> Let professionals handle the dirty work.</p>
