		<h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">TL;DR: The iHousing 3-Minute SEO Hack</h2>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
			<li><strong>Freshness:</strong> Update your calendar DAILY (even if no change).</li>
			<li><strong>Click-Through Rate (CTR):</strong> Your first image is 90% of the battle.</li>
			<li><strong>Instant Book:</strong> Listings with Instant Book rank significantly higher.</li>
			<li><strong>Response Time:</strong> Reply within 5 minutes (iHousing average: 2 minutes).</li>

	<h2>Why Airbnb SEO is Different in 2026</h2>
	<p>Most hosts treat Airbnb SEO like Google SEO—stuffing keywords into titles and descriptions. In 2026, Airbnb's algorithm is much smarter. It prioritizes <strong>Guest Experience</strong> and <strong>Reliability</strong> over simple keyword matching.</p>

	<h2>1. The "Daily Pulse" Factor (Freshness)</h2>
	<p>Airbnb favors active hosts. We've found that simply logging into your host dashboard and clicking "Save" on your calendar—even if nothing changed—signals to the algorithm that your listing is actively managed. iHousing automates this daily "pulse" for all 100+ properties we manage.</p>

	<h2>2. Click-Through Rate (CTR) Optimization</h2>
	<p>If 1,000 people see your listing in search but only 5 click, Airbnb will drop your ranking. Your main photo is your primary "hook."
	<ul>
		<li>Use high-brightness, wide-angle shots.</li>
		<li>Highlight your unique selling point (USP) in the thumbnail (e.g., bathtub, view, or pool).</li>
		<li>Title tag matters: "Spacious Condo" (Bad) vs "Sky Pool Loft + 500Mbps WiFi @ Melaka Raya" (Good).</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>3. Instant Book & Cancellation Policy</h2>
	<p>Airbnb wants frictionless bookings. Turning on <strong>Instant Book</strong> gives you an immediate ranking boost. Similarly, choosing a "Flexible" or "Moderate" cancellation policy makes guests more likely to book, which improves your conversion rate—a primary ranking signal.</p>

	<h2>4. Response Rate and Speed</h2>
	<p>If you take 6 hours to reply, you're losing money. Airbnb tracks response time to the second. Our internal data shows listings that respond within 5 minutes maintain a 15-20% higher search position than those that respond in 1 hour.</p>

	<h2>5. Review Velocity & Quality</h2>
	<p>It's not just about 5 stars; it's about <em>how many</em> reviews you get per month. 5 reviews per month is better than 50 reviews from 2 years ago. iHousing uses automated follow-ups to ensure a 70%+ review rate for our hosts.</p>

	<h2>6. The Amenity "Filter" Trap</h2>
	<p>Guests search by filters. If you have a hair dryer but didn't check the box in your listing, you are invisible to anyone who filters for it. Audit your amenities list every quarter.</p>

		<h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<div class="space-y-4">
			<div>
				<h3 class="font-bold">Does price affect Airbnb SEO?</h3>
				<p>Yes. If your price is significantly higher than similar listings in your area with similar ratings, Airbnb will suppress your listing because it's less likely to convert.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="font-bold">Do keywords in my description help?</h3>
				<p>Only slightly. Airbnb's search engine is more visual and behavioral. Keywords help for Google search (SEO), but behavioral signals (clicks/bookings) drive internal Airbnb search.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="font-bold">How long does it take to see ranking changes?</h3>
				<p>Usually 24-48 hours after a major update to your listing, though calendar updates provide near-instant signals.</p>
