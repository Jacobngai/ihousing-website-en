<h2>Marketing to Singaporean Investors: Best Practices</h2>

<li>"9% ROI" (not "excellent returns")</li>
<li>"2.5 hour drive" (not "easy access from Singapore")</li>
</ul>

<strong>Use Singapore Dollar Equivalents</strong>
<p>Help them contextualize:</p>
<ul>
<li>"RM400,000 = SGD120,000"</li>
<li>"RM4,500/month = SGD1,350/month"</li>
<li>"RM250,000 loan = SGD75,000"</li>
</ul>

<strong>Provide Comparative Analysis</strong>
<p>Show versus Singapore options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"This condo = SGD120K, similar size in Singapore = SGD800K+"</li>
<li>"Yield: 9% vs. 2.5% in Singapore"</li>
<li>"Down payment: SGD24K vs. SGD200K in Singapore"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trust-Building Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Share Real Performance:</strong> Actual income statements (not projections)</li>

<li><strong>Show Problem Resolution:</strong> Examples of issues handled professionally</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate Longevity:</strong> 8+ years in business speaks louder than words</li>
