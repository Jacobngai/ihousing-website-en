<h2>Challenges of Lendu Investments</h2>

<h3>Seasonal Demand</h3>

<p>Nature tourism peaks during:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fruit seasons (durian months: June-August)</li>
    <li>School holidays (March, June, December)</li>
    <li>Dry months (January-March, less rain)</li>
</ul>

<p>Strategy: Market to different segments during low seasons (corporate retreats, solo wellness seekers, photography workshops).</p>

<h3>Maintenance Distance</h3>

<p>Rural properties require more attention:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Travel time for maintenance teams</li>
    <li>Guest check-in logistics (remote handovers)</li>
    <li>Emergency response challenges</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution: iHousing provides remote monitoring systems and coordinates with local service providers.</p>

<h3>Limited Walk-In Traffic</h3>

<p>Unlike Jonker Walk, there's no spontaneous tourist footfall. All bookings come from online marketing and repeat guests.</p>

<p>Strategy: Strong online presence, SEO optimization, and building a loyal guest database for repeat visits.</p>
