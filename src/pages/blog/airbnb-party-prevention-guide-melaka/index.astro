<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">How Do You Stop Airbnb Parties?</h3>
<p class="text-blue-700"><strong>Screening is your first defense. Ask for MyKad/Passport pre-arrival. Set a 2-night minimum stay on weekends (filters out impulsive party groups). Install a noise monitoring device.</strong> In Melaka, the biggest risk is local youth renting a condo for a "birthday bash." Once they are in, it's too late. You must stop them at the booking stage.</p>

<p>A trashed unit is every host's nightmare. Broken furniture, angry neighbors, and a fine from the JMB. But it is preventable. 90% of bad guests display warning signs before they check in.</p>

<p>At iHousing, we have hosted thousands of guests with near-zero major incidents. Here is our security protocol.</p>

<h2>The Red Flags: Spotting Trouble Early</h2>

<p>Watch out for these questions in the pre-booking chat:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li>"Is the pool open 24 hours?" (They plan to swim drunk at 3 AM).</li>
    <li>"Can I bring my own sound system/karaoke?" (Instant reject).</li>
    <li>"We are just a few friends hanging out." (Code for a party).</li>
    <li>Booking a 3-bedroom unit for 2 people on a Saturday night. (Suspicious).</li>
</ul>

<h2>The 3-Step Defense System</h2>

<h3>1. The "2-Night Minimum" Filter</h3>
<p>Party groups usually want a place for one night of chaos. By setting a 2-night minimum on weekends, you eliminate 80% of them. Serious travelers (families/couples) usually stay Friday to Sunday anyway.</p>

<h3>2. The ID Verification Gate</h3>
<p>We require a photo of the lead guest's MyKad or Passport <em>before</em> sending the check-in guide.
<br><strong>Why it works:</strong> People who plan to break rules hate giving their ID. If they refuse, we cancel the booking penalty-free.</p>

<h3>3. The Security Deposit</h3>
<p>We collect a <strong>RM 200 - RM 500 security deposit</strong> (via bank transfer or credit card hold).
<br><strong>Psychology:</strong> When their own money is on the line, guests behave significantly better.</p>

<h2>Technology: The Silent Watchdog</h2>

<p>We install <strong>NoiseAware</strong> (or similar decibel monitors) in our units. It doesn't record conversations, but it alerts our team if noise levels exceed 70 decibels for more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong>
<br><strong>10:00 PM:</strong> Noise alert triggers.
<br><strong>10:05 PM:</strong> We text the guest: "Hi, our noise sensor detected high volume. Please keep it down to avoid a fine."
<br><strong>10:15 PM:</strong> Noise usually stops. Problem solved without a confrontation.</p>

<h2>iHousing's 24/7 Enforcement Team</h2>

<p>Self-managing hosts often dread the 2 AM call from security. "Your unit is loud."</p>

<p>iHousing has a response team on the ground. If a party starts, we go there, shut it down, and evict the guests if necessary. We handle the police, the JMB, and the cleanup.</p>

<p><strong>Don't risk your property.</strong> Let us protect it.</p>
