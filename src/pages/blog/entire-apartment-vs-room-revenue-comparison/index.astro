<h1>Entire Apartment vs Room Rental: Revenue Comparison for Melaka Hosts</h1>

<p>Should you rent your entire Melaka apartment or offer individual rooms? This decision impacts your monthly income by <strong>thousands of ringgit</strong>. Let's compare both models with real data from iHousing's managed properties.</p>

<h2>Financial Comparison: 2-Bedroom Condo Example</h2>

<h3>Scenario: RM400,000 Property in Melaka Raya</h3>

<strong>Model A: Entire Apartment Rental</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Average nightly rate:</strong> RM300</li>
<li><strong>Occupancy rate:</strong> 70%</li>
<li><strong>Monthly nights booked:</strong> 21 nights</li>
<li><strong>Monthly gross income:</strong> RM6,300</li>
<li><strong>Operating costs:</strong> RM800 (cleaning, supplies, utilities)</li>
<li><strong>Monthly net income:</strong> <strong>RM5,500</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong>Model B: 2 Private Rooms</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Room 1 rate:</strong> RM150/night</li>
<li><strong>Room 2 rate:</strong> RM150/night</li>
<li><strong>Combined rate:</strong> RM300/night (when both occupied)</li>
<li><strong>Occupancy rate:</strong> 55% per room (booked independently)</li>
<li><strong>Monthly nights booked:</strong> 16-17 nights each</li>
<li><strong>Monthly gross income:</strong> RM4,800-5,100</li>
<li><strong>Operating costs:</strong> RM600 (lower cleaning frequency)</li>
<li><strong>Monthly net income:</strong> <strong>RM4,200-4,500</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Winner:</strong> Entire apartment earns <strong>RM1,000-1,300 more monthly</strong> in this scenario.</p>

<h2>When Private Rooms Make Sense</h2>

<h3>Specific Situations Favoring Room Rentals</h3>

<p>Private rooms can outperform entire rentals when:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Property Size:</strong> 4+ bedrooms where entire rental rates become prohibitively expensive</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Near universities/hospitals with long-term room demand</li>
<li><strong>Budget Market:</strong> Targeting price-sensitive travelers</li>
<li><strong>Owner Occupancy:</strong> You live in property and rent spare rooms</li>
</ol>
